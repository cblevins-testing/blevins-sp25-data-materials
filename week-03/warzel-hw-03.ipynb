       "'NARRATIVE OF SOJOURNER TRUTH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHER BIRTH AND PARENTAGE.\\n\\n\\nTHE subject of this biography, SOJOURNER TRUTH, as she now calls\\nherself-but whose name, originally, was Isabella-was born, as near as\\nshe can now calculate, between the years 1797 and 1800.  She was the\\ndaughter of James and Betsey, slaves of one Colonel Ardinburgh, Hurley,\\nUlster County, New York.\\n\\nColonel  Ardinburgh belonged to that class of people called Low Dutch.\\n\\n\\nOf her first master, she can give no account, as she must have been a\\nmere infant when he died; and she, with her parents and some ten or\\ntwelve other fellow human chattels, became the legal property of his\\nson, Charles Ardinburgh.  She distinctly remembers hearing her father\\nand mother say, that their lot was a fortunate one, as Master Charles\\nwas the best of the family,-being, comparatively speaking, a kind\\nmaster to his slaves.\\n\\n\\nJames and Betsey having, by their faithfulness, docility, and\\nrespectful behavior, won his particular regard, received from him\\nparticular favors-among which was a lot of land, lying back on the\\nslope of a mountain, where, by improving the pleasant evenings and\\nSundays, they managed to raise a little tobacco, corn, or flax; which\\nthey exchanged for extras, in the articles of food or clothing for\\nthemselves and children.  She has no remembrance that Saturday\\nafternoon was ever added to their own time, as it is by some masters in\\nthe Southern States.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACCOMMODATIONS.\\n\\n\\nAmong Isabella\\'s earliest recollections was the removal of her master,\\nCharles Ardinburgh, into his new house, which he had built for a hotel,\\nsoon after the decease of his father.  A cellar, under this hotel, was\\nassigned to his slaves, as their sleeping apartment,-all the slaves he\\npossessed, of both sexes, sleeping (as is quite common in a state of\\nslavery) in the same room.  She carries in her mind, to this day, a\\nvivid picture of this dismal chamber; its only lights consisting of a\\nfew panes of glass, through which she thinks the sun never shone, but\\nwith thrice reflected rays; and the space between the loose boards of\\nthe floor, and the uneven earth below, was often filled with mud and\\nwater, the uncomfortable splashings of which were as annoying as its\\nnoxious vapors must have been chilling and fatal to health.  She\\nshudders, even now, as she goes back in memory, and revisits this\\ncellar, and sees its inmates, of both sexes and all ages, sleeping on\\nthose damp boards, like the horse, with a little straw and a blanket;\\nand she wonders not at the rheumatisms, and fever-sores, and palsies,\\nthat distorted the limbs and racked the bodies of those fellow-slaves\\nin after-life.  Still, she does not attribute this cruelty-for cruelty\\nit certainly is, to be so unmindful of the health and comfort of any\\nbeing, leaving entirely out of sight his more important part, his\\neverlasting interests,-so much to any innate or constitutional cruelty\\nof the master, as to that gigantic inconsistency, that inherited habit\\namong slaveholders, of expecting a willing and intelligent obedience\\nfrom the slave, because he is a MAN-at the same time every thing\\nbelonging to the soul-harrowing system does its best to crush the last\\nvestige of a man within him; and when it is crushed, and often before,\\nhe is denied the comforts of life, on the plea that he knows neither\\nthe want nor the use of them, and because he is considered to be little\\nmore or little less than a beast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHER BROTHERS AND SISTERS.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsabella\\'s father was very tall and straight, when young, which gave\\nhim the name of \\'Bomefree\\'-low Dutch for tree-at least, this is\\nSOJOURNER\\'s pronunciation of it-and by this name he usually went.  The\\nmost familiar appellation of her mother was \\'Mau-mau Bett.\\'  She was\\nthe mother of some ten or twelve children; though Sojourner is far from\\nknowing the exact number of her brothers and sisters; she being the\\nyoungest, save one, and all older than herself having been sold before\\nher remembrance.  She was privileged to behold six of them while she\\nremained a slave.\\n\\n\\nOf the two that immediately preceded her in age, a boy of five years,\\nand a girl of three, who were sold when she was an infant, she heard\\nmuch; and she wishes that all who would fain believe that slave parents\\nhave not natural affection for their offspring could have listened as\\nshe did, while Bomefree and Mau-mau Bett,-their dark cellar lighted by\\na blazing pine-knot,-would sit for hours, recalling and recounting\\nevery endearing, as well as harrowing circumstance that taxed memory\\ncould supply, from the histories of those dear departed ones, of whom\\nthey had been robbed, and for whom their hearts still bled.  Among the\\nrest, they would relate how the little boy, on the last morning he was\\nwith them, arose with the birds, kindled a fire, calling for his\\nMau-mau to \\'come, for all was now ready for her\\'-little dreaming of the\\ndreadful separation which was so near at hand, but of which his parents\\nhad an uncertain, but all the more cruel foreboding.  There was snow on\\nthe ground, at the time of which we are speaking; and a large\\nold-fashioned sleigh was seen to drive up to the door of the late Col.\\nArdinburgh.  This event was noticed with childish pleasure by the\\nunsuspicious boy; but when he was taken and put into the sleigh, and\\nsaw his little sister actually shut and locked into the sleigh box, his\\neyes were at once opened to their intentions; and, like a frightened\\ndeer he sprang from the sleigh, and running into the house, concealed\\nhimself under a bed.  But this availed him little. He was re-conveyed\\nto the sleigh, and separated for ever from those whom God had\\nconstituted his natural guardians and protectors, and who should have\\nfound him, in return, a stay and a staff to them in their declining\\nyears.  But I make no comments on facts like these, knowing that the\\nheart of every slave parent will make its own comments, involuntarily\\nand correctly, as soon as each heart shall make the case its own.\\nThose who are not parents will draw their conclusions from the\\npromptings of humanity and philanthropy:-these, enlightened by reason\\nand revelation, are also unerring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHER RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsabella and Peter, her youngest brother, remained, with their parents,\\nthe legal property of Charles Ardinburgh till his decease, which took\\nplace when Isabella was near nine years old.\\n\\n\\nAfter this event, she was often surprised to find her mother in tears;\\nand when, in her simplicity, she inquired, \\'Mau-mau, what makes you\\ncry?\\' she would answer, \\'Oh, my child, I am thinking of your brothers\\nand sisters that have been sold away from me.\\'  And she would proceed\\nto detail many circumstances respecting them.  But Isabella long since\\nconcluded that it was the impending fate of her only remaining\\nchildren, which her mother but too well understood, even then, that\\ncalled up those memories from the past, and made them crucify her heart\\nafresh.\\n\\n\\nIn the evening, when her mother\\'s work was done, she would sit down\\nunder the sparkling vault of heaven, and calling her children to her,\\nwould talk to them of the only Being that could effectually aid or\\nprotect them.  Her teachings were delivered in Low Dutch, her only\\nlanguage, and, translated into English, ran nearly as follows:-\\n\\n\\n\\'My children, there is a God, who hears and sees you.\\' \\'A God, mau-mau!\\nWhere does he live?\\' asked the children.  \\'He lives in the sky,\\' she\\nreplied; \\'and when you are beaten, or cruelly treated, or fall into any\\ntrouble, you must ask help of him, and he will always hear and help\\nyou.\\'  She taught them to kneel and say the Lord\\'s Prayer.  She\\nentreated them to refrain from lying and stealing, and to strive to\\nobey their masters.\\n\\n\\nAt times, a groan would escape her, and she would break out in the\\nlanguage of the Psalmist-\\'Oh Lord, how long?\\' \\'Oh Lord, how long?\\' And\\nin reply to Isabella\\'s question-\\'What ails you, mau-mau?\\' her only\\nanswer was, \\'Oh, a good deal ails me\\'-\\'Enough ails me.\\'  Then again,\\nshe would point them to the stars, and say, in her peculiar language,\\n\\'Those are the same stars, and that is the same moon, that look down\\nupon your brothers and sisters, and which they see as they look up to\\nthem, though they are ever so far away from us, and each other.\\'\\n\\n\\nThus, in her humble way, did she endeavor to show them their Heavenly\\nFather, as the only being who could protect them in their perilous\\ncondition; at the same time, she would strengthen and brighten the\\nchain of family affection, which she trusted extended itself\\nsufficiently to connect the widely scattered members of her precious\\nflock.  These instructions of the mother were treasured up and held\\nsacred by Isabella, as our future narrative will show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE AUCTION.\\n\\n\\nAt length, the never-to-be-forgotten day of the terrible auction\\narrived, when the \\'slaves, horses, and other cattle\\' of Charles\\nArdinburgh, deceased, were to be put under the hammer, and again change\\nmasters.  Not only Isabella and Peter, but their mother, were now\\ndestined to the auction block, and would have been struck off with the\\nrest to the highest bidder, but for the following circumstance: A\\nquestion arose among the heirs, \\'Who shall be burdened with Bomefree,\\nwhen we have sent away his faithful Mau-mau Bett?\\'  He was becoming\\nweak and infirm; his limbs were painfully rheumatic and distorted-more\\nfrom exposure and hardship than from old age, though he was several\\nyears older than Mau-mau Bett: he was no longer considered of value,\\nbut must soon be a burden and care to some one.  After some contention\\non the point at issue, none being willing to be burdened with him, it\\nwas finally agreed, as most expedient for the heirs, that the price of\\nMau-mau Bett should be sacrificed, and she receive her freedom, on\\ncondition that she take care of and support her faithful James,-\\nfaithful, not only to her as a husband, but proverbially faithful as a\\nslave to those who would not willingly sacrifice a dollar for his\\ncomfort, now that he had commenced his descent into the dark vale of\\ndecrepitude and suffering.  This important decision was received as\\njoyful news indeed to our ancient couple, who were the objects of it,\\nand who were trying to prepare their hearts for a severe struggle, and\\none altogether new to them, as they had never before been separated;\\nfor, though ignorant, helpless, crushed in spirit, and weighed down\\nwith hardship and cruel bereavement, they were still human, and their\\nhuman hearts beat within them with as true an affection as ever caused\\na human heart to beat.  And their anticipated separation now, in the\\ndecline of life, after the last child had been torn from them, must\\nhave been truly appalling.  Another privilege was granted them-that of\\nremaining occupants of the same dark, humid cellar I have before\\ndescribed: otherwise, they were to support themselves as they best\\ncould.  And as her mother was still able to do considerable work, and\\nher father a little, they got on for some time very comfortably.  The\\nstrangers who rented the house were humane people, and very kind to\\nthem; they were not rich, and owned  no slaves.  How long this state of\\nthings continued, we are unable to say, as Isabella had not then\\nsufficiently cultivated her organ of time to calculate years, or even\\nweeks or hours.  But she thinks her mother must have lived several\\nyears after the death of Master Charles.  She remembers going to visit\\nher parents some three or four times before the death of her mother,\\nand a good deal of time seemed to her to intervene between each visit.\\n\\n\\nAt length her mother\\'s health began to decline-a fever-sore made its\\nravages on one of her limbs, and the palsy began to shake her frame;\\nstill, she and James tottered about, picking up a little here and\\nthere, which, added to the mites contributed by their kind neighbors,\\nsufficed to sustain life, and drive famine from the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDEATH OF MAU-MAU BETT.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne morning, in early autumn, (from the reason above mentioned, we\\ncannot tell what year,) Mau-mau Bett told James she would make him a\\nloaf of rye-bread, and get Mrs. Simmons, their kind neighbor, to bake\\nit for them, as she would bake that forenoon.  James told her he had\\nengaged to rake after the cart for his neighbors that morning; but\\nbefore he commenced, he would pole off some apples from a tree near,\\nwhich they were allowed to gather; and if she could get some of them\\nbaked with the bread, it would give a nice relish for their dinner.  He\\nbeat off the apples, and soon after, saw Mau-mau Bett come out and\\ngather them up.\\n\\n\\nAt the blowing of the horn for dinner, he groped his way into his\\ncellar, anticipating his humble, but warm and nourishing meal; when,\\nlo! instead of being cheered by the sight and odor of fresh-baked bread\\nand the savory apples, his cellar seemed more cheerless than usual, and\\nat first neither sight nor sound met eye or ear.  But, on groping his\\nway through the room, his staff, which he used as a pioneer to go\\nbefore, and warn him of danger, seemed to be impeded in its progress,\\nand a low, gurgling, choking sound proceeded from the object before\\nhim, giving him the first intimation of the truth as it was, that\\nMau-mau Bett, his bosom companion, the only remaining member of his\\nlarge family, had fallen in a fit of the palsy, and lay helpless and\\nsenseless on the earth!  Who among us, located in pleasant homes,\\nsurrounded with every comfort, and so many kind and sympathizing\\nfriends, can picture to ourselves the dark and desolate state of poor\\nold James-penniless, weak, lame, and nearly blind, as he was at the\\nmoment he found his companion was removed from him, and he was left\\nalone in the world, with no one to aid, comfort, or console him? for\\nshe never revived again, and lived only a few hours after being\\ndiscovered senseless by her poor bereaved James.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLAST DAYS OF BOMEFREE.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsabella and Peter were permitted to see the remains of their mother\\nlaid in their last narrow dwelling, and to make their bereaved father a\\nlittle visit, ere they returned to their servitude.  And most piteous\\nwere the lamentations of the poor old man, when, at last, they also\\nwere obliged to bid him \"Farewell!\"  Juan Fernandes, on his desolate\\nisland, was not so pitiable an object as this poor lame man.  Blind and\\ncrippled, he was too superannuated to think for a moment of taking care\\nof himself, and he greatly feared no persons would interest themselves\\nin his behalf. \\'Oh,\\' he would exclaim, \\'I had thought God would take me\\nfirst,-Mau-mau was so much smarter than I, and could get about and take\\ncare of herself;-and I am so old, and so helpless.  What is to become\\nof me?  I can\\'t do anything any more-my children are all gone, and here\\nI am left helpless and alone.\\'  \\'And then, as I was taking leave of\\nhim,\\' said his daughter, in relating it, \\'he raised his voice, and\\ncried aloud like a child-Oh, how he DID cry!  I HEAR it now -and\\nremember it as well as if it were but yesterday-poor old man!!!  He\\nthought God had done it all-and my heart bled within me at the sight of\\nhis misery.  He begged me to get permission to come and see him\\nsometimes, which I readily and heartily promised him.\\'  But when all\\nhad left him, the Ardinburghs, having some feeling left for their\\nfaithful and favorite slave, \\'took turns about\\' in keeping him-\\npermitting him to stay a few weeks at one house, and then a while at\\nanother, and so around.  If, when he made a removal, the place where he\\nwas going was not too far off, he took up his line of march, staff in\\nhand, and asked for no assistance.  If it was twelve or twenty miles,\\nthey gave him a ride.  While he was living in this way, Isabella was\\ntwice permitted to visit him.  Another time she walked twelve miles,\\nand carried her infant in her arms to see him, but when she reached\\nthe place where she hoped to find him, he had just left for a place\\nsome twenty miles distant, and she never saw him more.  The last time\\nshe did see him, she found him seated on a rock, by the road side,\\nalone, and far from any house.  He was then migrating from the house of\\none Ardinburgh to that of another, several miles distant.  His hair was\\nwhite like wool-he was almost blind-and his gait was more a creep than\\na walk-but the weather was warm and pleasant, and he did not dislike\\nthe journey.  When Isabella addressed him, he recognized her voice, and\\nwas exceeding glad to see her.  He was assisted to mount the wagon, was\\ncarried back to the famous cellar of which we have spoken, and there\\nthey held their last earthly conversation.  He again, as usual,\\nbewailed his loneliness,-spoke in tones of anguish of his many\\nchildren, saying, \"They are all taken away from me!  I have now not\\none to give me a cup of cold water-why should I live and not die?\"\\nIsabella, whose heart yearned over her father, and who would have made\\nany sacrifice to have been able to be with, and take care of him, tried\\nto comfort, by telling him that \\'she had heard the white folks say,\\nthat all the slaves in the State would be freed in ten years, and that\\nthen she would come and take care of him.\\'  \\'I would take just as good\\ncare of you as Mau-mau would, if she was here\\'-continued Isabel.  \\'Oh,\\nmy child,\\' replied he, \\'I cannot live that long.\\'  \\'Oh, do, daddy, do\\nlive, and I will take such good care of you,\\' was her rejoinder.  She\\nnow says, \\'Why, I thought then, in my ignorance, that he could live, if\\nhe would.  I just as much thought so, as I ever thought any thing in my\\nlife-and I insisted on his living: but he shook his head, and insisted\\nhe could not.\\'\\n\\n\\nBut before Bomefree\\'s good constitution would yield either to age,\\nexposure, or a strong desire to die, the Ardinburghs again tired of\\nhim, and offered freedom to two old slaves-Caesar, brother of Mau-mau\\nBett, and his wife Betsy-on condition that they should take care of\\nJames. (I was about to say, \\'their brother-in-law\\'-but as slaves are\\nneither husbands nor wives in law, the idea of their being\\nbrothers-in-law is truly ludicrous.)  And although they were too old\\nand infirm to take care of themselves, (Caesar having been afflicted\\nfor a long time with fever-sores, and his wife with the jaundice), they\\neagerly accepted the boon of freedom, which had been the life-long\\ndesire of their souls-though at a time when emancipation was to them\\nlittle more than destitution, and was a freedom more to be desired by\\nthe master than the slave.  Sojourner declares of the slaves in their\\nignorance, that \\'their thoughts are no longer than her finger.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDEATH OF BOMEFREE.\\n\\n\\n\\nA rude cabin, in a lone wood, far from any neighbors, was granted to\\nour freed friends, as the only assistance they were now to expect.\\nBomefree, from this time, found his poor needs hardly supplied, as his\\nnew providers were scarce able to administer to their own wants.\\nHowever, the time drew near when things were to be decidedly worse\\nrather than better; for they had not been together long, before Betty\\ndied, and shortly after, Caesar followed her to \\'that bourne from\\nwhence no traveller returns\\'-leaving poor James again desolate, and\\nmore helpless than ever before; as, this time, there was no kind family\\nin the house, and the Ardinburghs no longer invited him to their homes.\\nYet, lone, blind and helpless as he was, James for a time lived on.\\nOne day, an aged colored woman, named Soan, called at his shanty, and\\nJames besought her, in the most moving manner, even with tears, to\\ntarry awhile and wash and mend him up, so that he might once more be\\ndecent and comfortable; for he was suffering dreadfully with the filth\\nand vermin that had collected upon him.\\n\\n\\nSoan was herself an emancipated slave, old and weak, with no one to\\ncare for her; and she lacked the courage to undertake a job of such\\nseeming magnitude, fearing she might herself get sick, and perish there\\nwithout assistance; and with great reluctance, and a heart swelling\\nwith pity, as she afterwards declared, she felt obliged to leave him in\\nhis wretchedness and filth.  And shortly after her visit, this faithful\\nslave, this deserted wreck of humanity, was found on his miserable\\npallet, frozen and stiff in death.  The kind angel had come at last,\\nand relieved him of the many miseries that his fellow-man had heaped\\nupon him.  Yes, he had died, chilled and starved, with none to speak a\\nkindly word, or do a kindly deed for him, in that last dread of hour of\\nneed!\\n\\n\\nThe news of his death reached the ears of John Ardinburgh, a grandson\\nof the old Colonel; and he declared that \\'Bomefree, who had ever been a\\nkind and faithful slave, should now have a good funeral.\\'  And now,\\ngentle reader, what think you constituted a good funeral?  Answer-some\\nblack paint for the coffin, and-a jug of ardent spirits!  What a\\ncompensation for a life of toil, of patient submission to repeated\\nrobberies of the most aggravated kind, and, also, far more than\\nmurderous neglect!!  Mankind often vainly attempts to atone for\\nunkindness or cruelty to the living, by honoring the same after death;\\nbut John Ardinburgh undoubtably meant his pot of paint and jug of\\nwhisky should act as an opiate on his slaves, rather than on his own\\nseared conscience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENCEMENT OF ISABELLA\\'S TRIALS IN LIFE.\\n\\n\\nHaving seen the sad end of her parents, so far as it relates to this\\nearthly life, we will return with Isabella to that memorable auction\\nwhich threatened to separate her father and mother.  A slave auction is\\na terrible affair to its victims, and its incidents and consequences\\nare graven on their hearts as with a pen of burning steel.\\n\\n\\nAt this memorable time, Isabella was struck off, for the sum of one\\nhundred dollars, to one John Nealy, of Ulster County, New York; and she\\nhas an impression that in this sale she was connected with a lot of\\nsheep.  She was now nine years of age, and her trials in life may be\\ndated from this period.  She says, with emphasis, \\'Now the war begun. \\'\\nShe could only talk Dutch-and the Nealys could only talk English.  Mr.\\nNealy could understand Dutch, but Isabel and her mistress could neither\\nof them understand the language of the other-and this, of itself, was a\\nformidable obstacle in the way of a good understanding between them,\\nand for some time was a fruitful source of dissatisfaction to the\\nmistress, and of punishment and suffering to Isabella.  She says, \\'If\\nthey sent me for a frying-pan, not knowing what they meant, perhaps I\\ncarried them pot-hooks and trammels.  Then, oh! how angry mistress\\nwould be with me!\\'  Then she suffered \\'terribly-terribly \\', with the\\ncold.  During the winter her feet were badly frozen, for want of\\nproper covering.  They gave her a plenty to eat, and also a plenty of\\nwhippings.  One Sunday morning, in particular, she was told to go to\\nthe barn; on going there, she found her master with a bundle of rods,\\nprepared in the embers, and bound together with cords.   When he had\\ntied her hands together before her, he gave her the most cruel whipping\\nshe was ever tortured with.  He whipped her till the flesh was deeply\\nlacerated, and the blood streamed from her wounds-and the scars remain\\nto the present day, to testify to the fact.  \\'And now,\\' she says, \\'when\\nI hear \\'em tell of whipping women on the bare flesh, it makes my flesh\\ncrawl, and my very hair rise on my head!  Oh! my God!\\' she continues,\\n\\'what a way is this of treating human beings?\\'  In those hours of her\\nextremity, she did not forget the instructions of her mother, to go to\\nGod in all her trials, and every affliction; and she not only\\nremembered, but obeyed: going to him, \\'and telling him all-and asking\\nHim if He thought it was right,\\' and begging him to protect and shield\\nher from her persecutors.\\n\\n\\nShe always asked with an unwavering faith that she should receive just\\nwhat she pleaded for,-\\'And now,\\' she says, \\'though it seems curious, I\\ndo not remember ever asking for any thing but what I got it.  And I\\nalways received it as an answer to my prayers.  When I got beaten, I\\nnever knew it long enough to go beforehand to pray; and I always\\nthought that if I only had had time to pray to God for help, I should\\nhave escaped the beating.\\'  She had no idea God had any knowledge of\\nher thoughts, save what she told him; or heard her prayers, unless they\\nwere spoken audibly.  And consequently, she could not pray unless she\\nhad time and opportunity to go by herself, where she could talk to God\\nwithout being overheard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTRIALS CONTINUED.\\n\\n\\nWhen she had been at Mr. Nealy\\'s several months, she began to beg God\\nmost earnestly to send her father to her, and as soon as she commenced\\nto pray, she began as confidently to look for his coming, and, ere it\\nwas long, to her great joy, he came.  She had no opportunity to speak\\nto him of the troubles that weighed so heavily on her spirit, while he\\nremained; but when he left, she followed him to the gate, and\\nunburdened her heart to him, inquiring if he could not do something to\\nget her a new and better place.  In this way the slaves often assist\\neach other, by ascertaining who are kind to their slaves,\\ncomparatively; and then using their influence to get such an one to\\nhire or buy their friends; and masters, often from policy, as well as\\nfrom latent humanity, allow those they are about to sell or let, to\\nchoose their own places, if the persons they happen to select for\\nmasters are considered safe pay.  He promised to do all he could, and\\nthey parted.  But, every day, as long as the snow lasted, (for there\\nwas snow on the ground at the time,) she returned to the spot where\\nthey separated, and walking in the tracks her father had made in the\\nsnow, repeated her prayer that \\'God would help her father get her a new\\nand better place.\\'\\n\\n\\nA long time had not elapsed, when a fisherman by the name of Scriver\\nappeared at Mr. Nealy\\'s, and inquired of Isabel \\'if she would like to\\ngo and live with him.\\'  She eagerly answered  \\'Yes,\\' and nothing\\ndoubting but he was sent in answer to her prayer; and she soon started\\noff with him, walking while he rode; for he had bought her at the\\nsuggestion of her father, paying one hundred and five dollars for her.\\nHe also lived in Ulster County, but some five or six miles from Mr.\\nNealy\\'s.\\n\\n\\nScriver, besides being a fisherman, kept a tavern for the\\naccommodation of people of his own class-for his was a rude,\\nuneducated family, exceedingly profane in their language, but, on the\\nwhole, an honest, kind and well-disposed people.\\n\\n\\nThey owned a large farm, but left it wholly unimproved; attending\\nmainly to their vocations of fishing and inn-keeping.  Isabella\\ndeclares she can ill describe the kind of life she led with them.  It\\nwas a wild, out-of-door kind of lief.  She was expected to carry fish,\\nto hoe corn, to bring roots and herbs from the woods for beers, go to\\nthe Strand for a gallon of molasses or liquor as the case might\\nrequire, and \\'browse around,\\' as she expresses it.  It was a life that\\nsuited her well for the time-being as devoid of hardship or terror as\\nit was of improvement; a need which had not yet become a want.  Instead\\nof improving at this place, morally, she retrograded, as their example\\ntaught her to curse; and it was here that she took her first oath.\\nAfter living with them for about a year and a half, she was sold to one\\nJohn J. Dumont, for the sum of seventy pounds.  This was in 1810.  Mr.\\nDumont lived in the same county as her former masters, in the town of\\nNew Paltz, and she remained with him till a short time previous to her\\nemancipation by the State, in 1828.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHER STANDING WITH HER NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS.\\n\\n\\nHad Mrs. Dumont possessed that vein of kindness and consideration for\\nthe slaves, so perceptible in her husband\\'s character, Isabella would\\nhave been as comfortable here, as one had best be, if one  must be a\\nslave.  Mr. Dumont had been nursed in the very lap of slavery, and\\nbeing naturally a man of kind feelings, treated his slaves with all the\\nconsideration he did his other animals, and more, perhaps.  But Mrs.\\nDumont, who had been born and educated in a non-slaveholding family,\\nand, like many others, used only to work-people, who, under the most\\nstimulating of human motives, were willing to put forth their every\\nenergy, could not have patience with the creeping gait, the dull\\nunderstanding, or see any cause for the listless manners and careless,\\nslovenly habits of the poor down-trodden outcast-entirely forgetting\\nthat every high and efficient motive had been removed far from him; and\\nthat, had not his very intellect been crushed out of him, the slave\\nwould find little ground for aught but hopeless despondency.  From this\\nsource arose a long series of trials in the life of our heroine, which\\nwe must pass over in silence; some from motives of delicacy, and\\nothers, because the relation of them might inflict undeserved pain on\\nsome now living, whom Isabel remembers only with esteem and love;\\ntherefore, the reader will not be surprised if our narrative appears\\nsomewhat tame at this point, and may rest assured that it is not for\\nwant of facts, as the most thrilling incidents of this portion of her\\nlife are from various motives suppressed.\\n\\n\\nOne comparatively trifling incident she wishes related, as it made a\\ndeep impression on her mind at the time-showing, as she thinks, how God\\nshields the innocent, and causes them to triumph over their enemies,\\nand also how she stood between master and mistress.  In her family,\\nMrs. Dumont employed two white girls, one of whom, named Kate, evinced\\na disposition to \\'lord it over\\' Isabel, and, in her emphatic language,\\n\\'to grind her down \\'.  Her master often shielded her from the attacks\\nand accusations of others, praising her for her readiness and ability\\nto work, and these praises seemed to foster a spirit of hostility to\\nher, in the minds of Mrs. Dumont and her white servant, the latter of\\nwhom took every opportunity to cry up her faults, lessen her in the\\nesteem of her master and increase against her the displeasure of her\\nmistress, which was already more than sufficient for Isabel\\'s comfort.\\nHer master insisted that she could do as much work as half a dozen\\ncommon people, and do it well, too; whilst her mistress insisted that\\nthe\\n\\n\\nfirst was true, only\\nbecause it ever came from her hand but half performed. A good\\ndeal of feeling arose from this difference of opinion, which was\\ngetting to rather an uncomfortable height, when, all at once, the\\npotatoes that Isabel cooked for breakfast assumed a dingy, dirty\\nlook. Her mistress blamed her severely, asking her master to\\nobserve \\'a fine specimen of Bell\\'s work!\\'-adding, \\'it is the\\nway all her work is done.\\' Her master scolded also this time, and\\ncommanded her to be more careful in future. Kate joined with\\nzest in the censures, and was very hard upon her. Isabella\\nthought that she had done all she well could to have them nice;\\nand became quite distressed at their appearances, and wondered\\nwhat she should do to avoid them. In this dilemma, Gertrude\\nDumont (Mr. D.\\'s eldest child, a good, kind-hearted girl of ten\\nyears, who pitied Isabel sincerely), when she heard them all\\nblame her so unsparingly, came forward, offering her sympathy\\nand assistance; and when about to retire to bed, on the night of\\nIsabella\\'s humiliation, she advanced to Isabel, and told her, if she\\nwould wake her early next morning, she would get up and\\nattend to her potatoes for her, while she (Isabella) went to\\nmilking, and they would see if they could not have them nice,\\nand not have \\'Poppee,\\' her word for father, and \\'Matty,\\' her\\nword for mother, and all of \\'em, scolding so terribly.\\n\\nIsabella gladly availed herself of this kindness, which touched\\nher to the heart, amid so much of an opposite spirit. When\\nIsabella had put the potatoes over to boil, Getty told her she\\nwould herself tend the fire, while Isabel milked. She had not\\nlong been seated by the fire, in performance of her promise,\\nwhen Kate entered, and requested Gertrude to go out of the\\nroom and do something for her, which she refused, still keeping\\nher place in the corner. While there, Kate came sweeping about\\nthe fire, caught up a chip, lifted some ashes with it, and dashed\\nthem into the kettle. Now the mystery was solved, the plot\\ndiscovered! Kate was working a little too fast at making her\\nmistress\\'s words good, at showing that Mrs. Dumont and herself\\nwere on the right side of the dispute, and consequently at gaining\\npower over Isabella. Yes, she was quite too fast, inasmuch as\\nshe had overlooked the little figure of justice, which sat in the\\ncomer, with scales nicely balanced, waiting to give all their dues.\\n\\nBut the time had come when she was to be overlooked no\\nlonger. It was Getty\\'s turn to speak now. \\'Oh Poppee! oh\\nPoppee!\\' said she, \\'Kate has been putting ashes in among the\\npotatoes! I saw her do it! Look at those that fell on the outside\\nof the kettle! You can now see what made the potatoes so dingy\\nevery morning, though Bell washed them clean!\\' And she repeated\\nher story to every new comer, till the fraud was made as\\npublic as the censure of Isabella had been. Her mistress looked\\nblank, and remained dumb-her master muttered something\\nwhich sounded very like an oath-and poor Kate was so chop-fallen, she\\nlooked like a convicted criminal, who would gladly\\nhave hid herself, (now that the baseness was out,) to conceal her\\nmortified pride and deep chagrin.\\n\\nIt was a fine triumph for Isabella and her master, and she\\nbecame more ambitious than ever to please him; and he stimulated\\nher ambition by his commendation, and by boasting of her\\nto his friends, telling them that \\'that wench\\' (pointing to Isabel)\\n\\'is better to me than a man-for she will do a good family\\'s\\nwashing in the night, and be ready in the morning to go into the\\nfield, where she will do as much at raking and binding as my best\\nhands.\\' Her ambition and desire to please were so great, that she\\noften worked several nights in succession, sleeping only short\\nsnatches, as she sat in her chair; and some nights she would not\\nallow herself to take any sleep, save what she could get resting\\nherself against the wall, fearing that if she sat down, she would\\nsleep too long. These extra exertions to please, and the praises\\nconsequent upon them, brought upon her head the envy of her\\nfellow-slaves, and they taunted her with being the \\'white folks\\'\\nnigger.\\'  On the other hand, she received the larger share of the\\nconfidence of her master, and many small favors that were by\\nthem unattainable. I asked her if her master, Dumont, ever\\nwhipped her? She answered, \\'Oh yes, he sometimes whipped\\nme soundly, though never cruelly. And the most severe whipping\\nhe ever give me was because I was cruel to a cat.\\' At this\\ntime she looked upon her master as a God; and believed that he\\nknew of and could see her at all times, even as God himself. And\\nshe used sometimes to confess her delinquencies, from the conviction\\nthat he already knew them, and that she should fare\\nbetter if she confessed voluntarily: and if any one talked to her\\nof the injustice of her being a slave, she answered them with\\ncontempt, and immediately told her master. She then firmly\\nbelieved that slavery was right and honorable. Yet she now sees\\nvery clearly the false position they were all in, both masters and\\nslaves; and she looks back, with utter astonishment, at the absurdity\\nof the claims so arrogantly set up by the masters, over\\nbeings designed by God to be as free as kings; and at the perfect\\nstupidity of the slave, in admitting for one moment the validity\\nof these claims.\\n\\nIn obedience to her mother\\'s instructions, she had educated\\nherself to such a sense of honesty, that, when she had become a\\nmother, she would sometimes whip her child when it cried to\\nher for bread, rather than give it a piece secretly, lest it should\\nlearn to take what was not its own! And the writer of this knows,\\nfrom personal observation, that the slaveholders of the South feel\\nit to be a religious duty to teach their slaves to be honest, and\\nnever to take what is not their own! Oh consistency, art thou not\\na jewel? Yet Isabella glories in the fact that she was faithful and\\ntrue to her master; she says, \\'It made me true to my God\\'-meaning,\\nthat it helped to form in her a character that loved\\ntruth, and hated a lie, and had saved her from the bitter pains\\nand fears that are sure to follow in the wake of insincerity and\\nhypocrisy.\\n\\nAs she advanced in years, an attachment sprung up between\\nherself and a slave named Robert. But his master, an Englishman\\nby the name of Catlin, anxious that no one\\'s property but his\\nown should be enhanced by the increase of his slaves, forbade\\nRobert\\'s visits to Isabella, and commanded him to take a wife\\namong his fellow-servants. Notwithstanding this interdiction,\\nRobert, following the bent of his inclinations, continued his\\nvisits to Isabel, though very stealthily, and, as he believed, without\\nexciting the suspicion of his master; but one Saturday afternoon,\\nhearing that Bell was ill, he took the liberty to go and see\\nher. The first intimation she had of his visit was the appearance\\nof her master, inquiring \\'if she had seen Bob.\\' On her answering\\nin the negative, he said to her, \\'If you see him, tell him to\\ntake care of himself, for the Catlins are after him.\\' Almost at that\\ninstant, Bob made his appearance; and the first people he met\\nwere his old and his young masters. They were terribly enraged\\nat finding him there, and the eldest began cursing, and calling\\nupon his son to \\'Knock down the d-d black rascal\\'; at the\\nsame time, they both fell upon him like tigers, beating him with\\nthe heavy ends of their canes, bruising and mangling his head\\nand face in the most awful manner, and causing the blood, which\\nstreamed from his wounds, to cover him like a slaughtered beast,\\nconstituting him a most shocking spectacle. Mr. Dumont interposed\\nat this point, telling the ruffians they could no longer thus\\nspill human blood on his premises-he would have \\'no niggers\\nkilled there.\\' The Catlins then took a rope they had taken with\\nthem for the purpose, and tied Bob\\'s hands behind him in such\\na manner, that Mr. Dumont insisted on loosening the cord,\\ndeclaring that no brute should be tied in that manner, where he\\nwas. And as they led him away, like the greatest of criminals, the\\nmore humane Dumont followed them to their homes, as Robert\\'s\\nprotector; and when he returned, he kindly went to Bell,\\nas he called her, telling her he did not think they would strike\\nhim any more, as their wrath had greatly cooled before he left\\nthem. Isabella had witnessed this scene from her window, and\\nwas greatly shocked at the murderous treatment of poor Robert,\\nwhom she truly loved, and whose only crime, in the eye of his\\npersecutors, was his affection for her. This beating, and we know\\nnot what after treatment, completely subdued the spirit of its\\nvictim, for Robert ventured no more to visit Isabella, but like an\\nobedient and faithful chattel, took himself a wife from the house\\nof his master. Robert did not live many years after his last visit\\nto Isabel, but took his departure to that country, where \\'they\\nneither marry nor are given in marriage,\\' and where the oppressor\\ncannot molest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nISABELLA\\'S MARRIAGE.\\n\\n\\nSubsequently, Isabella was married to a fellow-slave, named\\nThomas, who had previously had two wives, one of whom, if\\nnot both, had been torn from him and sold far away. And it is\\nmore than probable, that he was not only allowed but encouraged\\nto take another at each successive sale. I say it is probable,\\nbecause the writer of this knows from personal observation, that\\nsuch is the custom among slaveholders at the present day; and\\nthat in a twenty months\\' residence among them, we never knew\\nany one to open the lip against the practice; and when we\\nseverely censured it, the slaveholder had nothing to say; and the\\nslave pleaded that, under existing circumstances, he could do no\\nbetter.\\n\\nSuch an abominable state of things is silently tolerated, to say\\nthe least, by slaveholders-deny it who may. And what is that\\nreligion that sanctions, even by its silence, all that is embraced in\\nthe \\'Peculiar Institution? \\' If there can be any thing more\\ndiametrically opposed to the religion of Jesus, than the working of\\nthis\\nsoul-killing system-which is as truly sanctioned by the religion\\nof America as are her ministers and churches-we wish to be\\nshown where it can be found.\\n\\nWe have said, Isabella was married to Thomas-she was,\\nafter the fashion of slavery, one of the slaves performing the\\nceremony for them; as no true minister of Christ can perform, as\\nin the presence of God, what he knows to be a mere farce, a mock\\nmarriage, unrecognised by any civil law, and liable to be annulled\\nany moment, when the interest or caprice of the master\\nshould dictate.\\n\\nWith what feelings must slaveholders expect us to listen to\\ntheir horror of amalgamation in prospect, while they are well\\naware that we know how calmly and quietly they contemplate\\nthe present state of licentiousness their own wicked laws have\\ncreated, not only as it regards the slave, but as it regards the more\\nprivileged portion of the population of the South?\\n\\nSlaveholders appear to me to take the same notice of the vices\\nof the slave, as one does of the vicious disposition of his horse.\\nThey are often an inconvenience; further than that, they care\\nnot to trouble themselves about the matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nISABELLA AS A MOTHER.\\n\\n\\nIn process of time, Isabella found herself the mother of five\\nchildren, and she rejoiced in being permitted to be the instrument\\nof increasing the property of her oppressors! Think, dear\\nreader, without a blush, if you can, for one moment, of a mother\\nthus willingly, and with pride, laying her own children, the \\'flesh\\nof her flesh,\\' on the altar of slavery-a sacrifice to the bloody\\nMoloch! But we must remember that beings capable of such\\nsacrifices are not mothers; they are only \\'things,\\'\\n\\'chattels,\\' \\'property.\\'\\n\\nBut since that time, the subject of this narrative has made\\nsome advances from a state of chattelism towards that of a\\nwoman and a mother; and she now looks back upon her\\nthoughts and feelings there, in her state of ignorance and\\ndegradation,\\nas one does on the dark imagery of a fitful dream. One\\nmoment it seems but a frightful illusion; again it appears a terrible\\nreality. I would to God it were but a dreamy myth, and not, as\\nit now stands, a horrid reality to some three millions of chattelized\\nhuman beings.\\n\\nI have already alluded to her care not to teach her children\\nto steal, by her example; and she says, with groanings that cannot\\nbe written, \\'The Lord only knows how many times I let my\\nchildren go hungry, rather than take secretly the bread I liked\\nnot to ask for.\\' All parents who annul their preceptive teachings\\nby their daily practices would do well to profit by her example.\\n\\nAnother proof of her master\\'s kindness of heart is found in\\nthe following fact. If her master came into the house and found\\nher infant crying, (as she could not always attend to its wants and\\nthe commands of her mistress at the same time,) he would turn\\nto his wife with a look of reproof, and ask her why she did not\\nsee the child taken care of; saying, most earnestly, \\'I will not\\nhear this crying; I can\\'t bear it, and I will not hear any child cry\\nso. Here, Bell, take care of this child, if no more work is done\\nfor a week.\\' And he would linger to see if his orders were\\nobeyed, and not countermanded.\\n\\nWhen Isabella went to the field to work, she used to put her\\ninfant in a basket, tying a rope to each handle, and suspending\\nthe basket to a branch of a tree, set another small child to swing\\nit. It was thus secure from reptiles and was easily administered to,\\nand even lulled to sleep, by a child too young for other labors.\\nI was quite struck with the ingenuity of such a baby-tender, as\\nI have sometimes been with the swinging hammock the native\\nmother prepares for her sick infant-apparently so much easier\\nthan aught we have in our more civilized homes; easier for the\\nchild, because it gets the motion without the least jar; and easier\\nfor the nurse, because the hammock is strung so high as to\\nsupersede the necessity of stooping.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSLAVEHOLDER\\'S PROMISES.\\n\\n\\nAfter emancipation had been decreed by the State, some years\\nbefore the time fixed for its consummation, Isabella\\'s master told\\nher if she would do well, and be faithful, he would give her \\'free\\npapers,\\' one year before she was legally free by statute. In the\\nyear 1826, she had a badly diseased hand, which greatly diminished\\nher usefulness; but on the arrival of July 4, 1827, the time\\nspecified for her receiving her \\'free papers,\\' she claimed the\\nfulfilment of her master\\'s promise; but he refused granting it, on\\naccount (as he alleged) of the loss he had sustained by her hand.\\nShe plead that she had worked all the time, and done many\\nthings she was not wholly able to do, although she knew she had\\nbeen less useful than formerly; but her master remained inflexible.\\nHer very faithfulness probably operated against her now,\\nand he found it less easy than he thought to give up the profits\\nof his faithful Bell, who had so long done him efficient service.\\n\\nBut Isabella inwardly determined that she would remain quietly\\nwith him only until she had spun his wool-about one\\nhundred pounds-and then she would leave him, taking the rest\\nof the time to herself. \\'Ah!\\' she says, with emphasis that cannot\\nbe written, \\'the slaveholders are TERRIBLE for promising to give\\nyou this or that, or such and such a privilege, if you will do thus\\nand so; and when the time of fulfilment comes, and one claims\\nthe promise, they, forsooth, recollect nothing of the kind: and\\nyou are, like as not, taunted with being a LIAR; or, at best, the\\nslave is accused of not having performed his part or condition of\\nthe contract.\\' \\'Oh!\\' said she, \\'I have felt as if I could not live\\nthrough the operation sometimes. Just think of us! so eager for our\\npleasures, and just foolish enough to keep feeding and feeding\\nourselves up with the idea that we should get what had been thus\\nfairly promised; and when we think it is almost in our hands, find\\nourselves flatly denied! Just think! how could we bear it? Why,\\nthere was Charles Brodhead promised his slave Ned, that when\\nharvesting was over, he might go and see his wife, who lived\\nsome twenty or thirty miles off. So Ned worked early and late,\\nand as soon as the harvest was all in, he claimed the promised\\nboon. His master said, he had merely told him he \\'would see if\\nhe could go, when the harvest was over; but now he saw that\\nhe could not go.\\' But Ned, who still claimed a positive promise,\\non which he had fully depended, went on cleaning his shoes. His\\nmaster asked him if he intended going, and on his replying \\'yes,\\'\\ntook up a sled-stick that lay near him, and gave him such a blow\\non the head as broke his skull, killing him dead on the spot. The\\npoor colored people all felt struck down by the blow.\\' Ah! and\\nwell they might. Yet it was but one of a long series of bloody,\\nand other most effectual blows, struck against their liberty and\\ntheir lives. * But to return from our digression.\\n\\nThe subject of this narrative was to have been free July 4,\\n1827, but she continued with her master till the wool was spun,\\nand the heaviest of the \\'fall\\'s work\\' closed up, when she concluded\\nto take her freedom into her own hands, and seek her\\nfortune in some other place.\\n\\n\\nNote:\\n*Yet no official notice was taken of his more than brutal murder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHER ESCAPE.\\n\\n\\nThe question in her mind, and one not easily solved, now was,\\n\\'How can I get away?\\' So, as was her usual custom, she \\'told\\nGod she was afraid to go in the night, and in the day every body\\nwould see her.\\' At length, the thought came to her that she\\ncould leave just before the day dawned, and get out of the\\nneighborhood where she was known before the people were\\nmuch astir. \\'Yes,\\' said she, fervently, \\'that\\'s a good thought!\\nThank you, God, for that thought!\\' So, receiving it as coming\\ndirect from God, she acted upon it, and one fine morning, a little\\nbefore day-break, she might have been seen stepping stealthily\\naway from the rear of Master Dumont\\'s house, her infant on one\\narm and her wardrobe on the other; the bulk and weight of\\nwhich, probably, she never found so convenient as on the present\\noccasion, a cotton handkerchief containing both her clothes\\nand her provisions.\\n\\nAs she gained the summit of a high hill, a considerable distance\\nfrom her master\\'s, the sun offended her by coming forth\\nin all his pristine splendor. She thought it never was so light\\nbefore; indeed, she thought it much too light. She stopped to\\nlook about her, and ascertain if her pursuers were yet in sight.\\nNo one appeared, and, for the first time, the question came up\\nfor settlement, \\'Where, and to whom, shall I go?\\' In all her\\nthoughts of getting away, she had not once asked herself whither\\nshe should direct her steps. She sat down, fed her infant, and\\nagain turning her thoughts to God, her only help, she prayed\\nhim to direct her to some safe asylum. And soon it occurred\\nto her, that there was a man living somewhere in the direction\\nshe had been pursuing, by the name of Levi Rowe, whom she\\nhad known, and who, she thought, would be likely to befriend\\nher. She accordingly pursued her way to his house, where she\\nfound him ready to entertain and assist her, though he was then\\non his death-bed. He bade her partake of the hospitalities of his\\nhouse, said he knew of two good places where she might get in,\\nand requested his wife to show her where they were to be found.\\nAs soon as she came in sight of the first house, she recollected\\nhaving seen it and its inhabitants before, and instantly exclaimed,\\n\\'That\\'s the place for me; I shall stop there.\\' She went there, and\\nfound the good people of the house, Mr. and Mrs. Van Wagener,\\nabsent, but was kindly received and hospitably entertained\\nby their excellent mother, till the return of her children.\\nWhen they arrived, she made her case known to them. They\\nlistened to her story, assuring her they never turned the needy\\naway, and willingly gave her employment.\\n\\nShe had not been there long before her old master, Dumont,\\nappeared, as she had anticipated; for when she took French leave\\nof him, she resolved not to go too far from him, and not put him\\nto as much trouble in looking her up-for the latter he was sure\\nto do-as Tom and Jack had done when they ran away from\\nhim, a short time before. This was very considerate in her, to say\\nthe least, and a proof that \\'like begets like.\\' He had often\\nconsidered her feelings, though not always, and she was equally\\nconsiderate.\\n\\nWhen her master saw her, he said, \\'Well, Bell, so you\\'ve run\\naway from me.\\' \\'No, I did not run away; I walked away by\\nday-light, and all because you had promised me a year of my\\ntime.\\' His reply was, \\'You must go back with me.\\' Her decisive\\nanswer was, \\'No, I won\\'t go back with you.\\' He said, \\'Well,\\nI shall take the child.\\' This also was as stoutly negatived.\\n\\nMr. Isaac S. Van Wagener then interposed, saying, he had\\nnever been in the practice of buying and selling slaves; he did not\\nbelieve in slavery; but, rather than have Isabella taken back by\\nforce, he would buy her services for the balance of the year-for\\nwhich her master charged twenty dollars, and five in addition for\\nthe child. The sum was paid, and her master Dumont departed;\\nbut not till he had heard Mr. Van Wagener tell her not to call\\nhim master-adding, \\'there is but one master; and he who is your\\nmaster is my master.\\' Isabella inquired what she should call him?\\nHe answered, \\'call me Isaac Van Wagener, and my wife is Maria\\nVan Wagener.\\' Isabella could not understand this, and thought\\nit a mighty change, as it most truly was from a master whose word\\nwas law, to simple Isaac S. Van Wagener, who was master to no\\none. With these noble people, who, though they could not be\\nthe masters of slaves, were undoubtedly a portion of God\\'s\\nnobility, she resided one year, and from them she derived the\\nname of Van Wagener; he being her last master in the eye of the\\nlaw, and a slave\\'s surname is ever the same as his master; that is,\\nif he is allowed to have any other name than Tom, Jack, or\\nGuffin. Slaves have sometimes been severely punished for adding\\ntheir master\\'s name to their own. But when they have no\\nparticular title to it, it is no particular offence.\\n\\n\\n\\nILLEGAL SALE OF HER SON.\\n\\n\\nA little previous to Isabel\\'s leaving her old master, he had sold\\nher child, a boy of five years, to a Dr. Gedney, who took him\\nwith him as far as New York city, on his way to England; but\\nfinding the boy too small for his service, he sent him back to his\\nbrother, Solomon Gedney. This man disposed of him to his\\nsister\\'s husband, a wealthy planter, by the name of Fowler, who\\ntook him to his own home in Alabama.\\n\\nThis illegal and fraudulent transaction had been perpetrated\\nsome months before Isabella knew of it, as she was now living\\nat Mr. Van Wagener\\'s. The law expressly prohibited the sale of\\nany slave out of the State,-and all minors were to be free at\\ntwenty-one years of age; and Mr. Dumont had sold Peter with\\nthe express understanding, that he was soon to return to the State\\nof New York, and be emancipated at the specified time.\\n\\nWhen Isabel heard that her son had been sold South, she\\nimmediately started on foot and alone, to find the man who had\\nthus dared, in the face of all law, human and divine, to sell her\\nchild out of the State; and if possible, to bring him to account\\nfor the deed.\\n\\nArriving at New Paltz, she went directly to her former mistress,\\nDumont, complaining bitterly of the removal of her son.\\nHer mistress heard her through, and then replied-\\'Ugh! a fine\\nfuss to make about a little nigger! Why, haven\\'t you as many of\\n\\'em left as you can see to, and take care of? A pity \\'tis, the niggers\\nare not all in Guinea!! Making such a halloo-balloo about the\\nneighborhood; and all for a paltry nigger!!!\\' Isabella heard her\\nthrough, and after a moment\\'s hesitation, answered, in tones of\\ndeep determination-\\'I\\'ll have my child again.\\' \\'Have your child\\nagain!\\' repeated her mistress-her tones big with contempt, and\\nscorning the absurd idea of her getting him. \\'How can you get\\nhim? And what have you to support him with, if you could?\\nHave you any money?\\' \\'No,\\' answered Bell, \\'I have no\\nmoney, but God has enough, or what\\'s better! And I\\'ll have my\\nchild again.\\' These words were pronounced in the most slow,\\nsolemn, and determined measure and manner. And in speaking\\nof it, she says, \\'Oh my God! I know\\'d I\\'d have him agin. I was\\nsure God would help me to get him. Why, I felt so tall within-I\\nfelt as if the power of a nation was with me!\\'\\n\\nThe impressions made by Isabella on her auditors, when\\nmoved by lofty or deep feeling, can never be transmitted to\\npaper, (to use the words of another,) till by some Daguerrian act,\\nwe are enabled to transfer the look, the gesture, the tones of\\nvoice, in connection with the quaint, yet fit expressions used,\\nand the spirit-stirring animation that, at such a time, pervades all\\nshe says.\\n\\nAfter leaving her mistress, she called on Mrs. Gedney, mother\\nof him who had sold her boy; who, after listening to her lamentations,\\nher grief being mingled with indignation at the sale of\\nher son, and her declaration that she would have him again-said,\\n\\'Dear me! What a disturbance to make about your child!\\nWhat, is your child, better than my child? My child is gone out\\nthere, and yours is gone to live with her, to have enough of\\nevery thing, and be treated like a gentleman!\\' And here she\\nlaughed at Isabel\\'s absurd fears, as she would represent them to\\nbe. \\'Yes,\\' said Isabel, \\'your child has gone there, but she is\\nmarried, and my boy has gone as a slave, and he is too little to go\\nso far from his mother. Oh, I must have my child.\\' And here the\\ncontinued laugh of Mrs. G. seemed to Isabel, in this time of\\nanguish and distress, almost demoniacal. And well it was for Mrs.\\nGedney, that, at that time, she could not even dream of the\\nawful fate awaiting her own beloved daughter, at the hands of\\nhim whom she had chosen as worthy the wealth of her love\\nand confidence, and in whose society her young heart had\\ncalculated on a happiness, purer and more elevated than was ever\\nconferred by a kingly crown. But, alas! she was doomed to\\ndisappointment, as we shall relate by and by. At this point,\\nIsabella earnestly begged of God that he would show to those\\nabout her that He was her helper; and she adds, in narrating,\\n\\'And He did; or, if He did not show them, he did me.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nIT IS OFTEN DARKEST JUST BEFORE DAWN.\\n\\n\\nThis homely proverb was illustrated in the case of our sufferer;\\nfor, at the period at which we have arrived in our narrative, to\\nher the darkness seemed palpable, and the waters of affliction\\ncovered her soul; yet light was about to break in upon her.\\n\\nSoon after the scenes related in our last chapter, which had\\nharrowed up her very soul to agony, she met a man, (we would\\nlike to tell you who, dear reader, but it would be doing him no\\nkindness, even at the present day, to do so,) who evidently\\nsympathized with her, and counselled her to go to the Quakers,\\ntelling her they were already feeling very indignant at the fraudulent\\nsale of her son, and assuring her that they would readily\\nassist her, and direct her what to do. He pointed out to her two\\nhouses, where lived some of those people, who formerly, more\\nthan any other sect, perhaps, lived out the principles of the\\ngospel of Christ. She wended her way to their dwellings, was\\nlistened to, unknown as she personally was to them, with patience,\\nand soon gained their sympathies and active co-operation.\\n\\nThey gave her lodgings for the night; and it is very amusing\\nto hear her tell of the \\'nice, high, clean, white, beautiful bed\\'\\nassigned her to sleep in, which contrasted so strangely with her\\nformer pallets, that she sat down and contemplated it, perfectly\\nabsorbed in wonder that such a bed should have been appropriated\\nto one like herself. For some time she thought that she\\nwould lie down beneath it, on her usual bedstead, the floor. \\'I\\ndid, indeed,\\' says she, laughing heartily at her former self. However,\\nshe finally concluded to make use of the bed, for fear that\\nnot to do so might injure the feelings of her good hostess. In the\\nmorning, the Quaker saw that she was taken and set down near\\nKingston, with directions to go to the Court House, and enter\\ncomplaint to the Grand Jury.\\n\\nBy a little inquiry, she found which was the building she\\nsought, went into the door, and taking the first man she saw of\\nimposing appearance for the grand jury, she commenced her\\ncomplaint. But he very civilly informed her there was no Grand\\nJury there; she must go up stairs. When she had with some\\ndifficulty ascended the flight through the crowd that filled them,\\nshe again turned to the \\'grandest \\' looking man she could select,\\ntelling him she had come to enter a complaint to the Grand Jury.\\nFor his own amusement, he inquired what her complaint was;\\nbut, when he saw it was a serious matter, he said to her, \\'This\\nis no place to enter a complaint-go in there,\\' pointing in a\\nparticular direction.\\n\\nShe then went in, where she found the Grand Jurors indeed\\nsitting, and again commenced to relate her injuries. After holding\\nsome conversation among themselves, one of them rose, and\\nbidding her follow him, led the way to a side office, where he\\nheard her story, and asked her \\'if she could swear that the child\\nshe spoke of was her son?\\' \\'Yes,\\' she answered, \\'I swear it\\'s my\\nson.\\' \\'Stop, stop!\\' said the lawyer, \\'you must swear by this\\nbook\\'-giving her a book, which she thinks must have been the\\nBible. She took it, and putting it to her lips, began again to swear\\nit was her child. The clerks, unable to preserve their gravity any\\nlonger, burst into an uproarious laugh; and one of them inquired\\nof lawyer Chip of what use it could be to make her swear. \\'It\\nwill answer the law,\\' replied the officer. He then made her\\ncomprehend just what he wished her to do, and she took a\\nlawful oath, as far as the outward ceremony could make it one.\\nAll can judge how far she understood its spirit and meaning.\\n\\nHe now gave her a writ, directing her to take it to the\\nconstable at New Paltz, and have him serve it on Solomon\\nGedney. She obeyed, walking, or rather trotting, in her haste,\\nsome eight or nine miles.\\n\\nBut while the constable, through mistake, served the writ on\\na brother of the real culprit, Solomon Gedney slipped into a\\nboat, and was nearly across the North River, on whose banks\\nthey were standing, before the dull Dutch constable was aware\\nof his mistake. Solomon Gedney, meanwhile, consulted a lawyer,\\nwho advised him to go to Alabama and bring back the boy,\\notherwise it might cost him fourteen years\\' imprisonment, and\\na thousand dollars in cash. By this time, it is hoped he began to\\nfeel that selling slaves unlawfully was not so good a business as\\nhe had wished to find it. He secreted himself till due preparations\\ncould be made, and soon set sail for Alabama. Steamboats and\\nrailroads had not then annihilated distance to the extent they\\nnow have, and although he left in the fall of the year, spring\\ncame ere he returned, bringing the boy with him-but holding\\non to him as his property. It had ever been Isabella\\'s prayer, not\\nonly that her son might be returned, but that he should be\\ndelivered from bondage, and into her own hands, lest he should\\nbe punished out of mere spite to her, who was so greatly annoying\\nand irritating to her oppressors; and if her suit was gained,\\nher very triumph would add vastly to their irritation.\\n\\nShe again sought advice of Esquire Chip, whose counsel was,\\nthat the aforesaid constable serve the before-mentioned writ\\nupon the right person. This being done, soon brought Solomon\\nGedney up to Kingston, where he gave bonds for his appearance\\nat court, in the sum of $600.\\n\\nEsquire Chip next informed his client, that her case must\\nnow lie over till the next session of the court, some months in\\nthe future. \\'The law must take its course,\\' said he.\\n\\n\\'What! wait another court! wait months?\\' said the persevering\\nmother. \\'Why, long before that time, he can go clear off,\\nand take my child with him-no one knows where. I cannot\\nwait; I must have him now, whilst he is to be had.\\' \\'Well,\\' said\\nthe lawyer, very coolly, \\'if he puts the boy out of the way, he\\nmust pay the $600-one half of which will be yours\\'; supposing,\\nperhaps, that $300 would pay for a \\'heap of children,\\' in\\nthe eye of a slave who never, in all her life, called a dollar her\\nown. But in this instance, he was mistaken in his reckoning. She\\nassured him, that she had not been seeking money, neither\\nwould money satisfy her; it was her son, and her son alone she\\nwanted, and her son she must have. Neither could she wait\\ncourt, not she. The lawyer used his every argument to convince\\nher, that she ought to be very thankful for what they had done\\nfor her; that it was a great deal, and it was but reasonable that she\\nshould now wait patiently the time of the court.\\n\\nYet she never felt, for a moment, like being influenced by\\nthese suggestions. She felt confident she was to receive a full and\\nliteral answer to her prayer, the burden of which had been-\\'O\\nLord, give my son into my hands, and that speedily! Let not the\\nspoilers have him any longer.\\' Notwithstanding, she very distinctly\\nsaw that those who had thus far helped her on so kindly\\nwere wearied of her, and she feared God was wearied also. She had\\na short time previous learned that Jesus was a Saviour, and an\\nintercessor; and she thought that if Jesus could but be induced to\\nplead\\nfor her in the present trial, God would listen to him, though he\\nwere wearied of her importunities. To him, of course, she applied.\\nAs she was walking about, scarcely knowing whither she went,\\nasking within herself, \\'Who will show me any good, and lend a\\nhelping hand in this matter,\\' she was accosted by a perfect\\nstranger, and one whose name she has never learned, in the\\nfollowing terms: \\'Halloo, there; how do you get along with your\\nboy? do they give him up to you?\\' She told him all, adding that\\nnow every body was tired, and she had none to help her. He said,\\n\\'Look here! I\\'ll tell you what you\\'d better do. Do you see that\\nstone house yonder?\\' pointing in a particular direction. \\'Well,\\nlawyer Demain lives there, and do you go to him, and lay your\\ncase before him; I think he\\'ll help you. Stick to him. Don\\'t give him\\npeace till he does. I feel sure if you press him, he\\'ll do it for you.\\'\\nShe needed no further urging, but trotted off at her peculiar gait in\\nthe direction of his house, as fast as possible,-and she was not\\nencumbered with stockings, shoes, or any other heavy article of\\ndress. When she had told him her story, in her impassioned\\nmanner, he looked at her a few moments, as if to ascertain if he\\nwere contemplating a new variety of the genus homo, and then\\ntold her, if she would give him five dollars, he would get her son\\nfor her, in twenty-four hours. \\'Why,\\' she replied, \\'I have no\\nmoney, and never had a dollar in my life!\\' Said he, \\'If you will go\\nto those Quakers in Poppletown, who carried you to court, they\\nwill help you to five dollars in cash, I have no doubt; and you shall\\nhave your son in twenty-four hours, from the time you bring me\\nthat sum.\\' She performed the journey to Poppletown, a distance\\nof some ten miles, very expeditiously; collected considerable\\nmore than the sum specified by the barrister; then, shutting the\\nmoney tightly in her hand, she trotted back, and paid the lawyer a\\nlarger fee than he had demanded. When inquired of by people\\nwhat she had done with the overplus, she answered, \\'Oh, I got it\\nfor lawyer Demain, and I gave it to him. \\' They assured her she was\\na fool to do so; that she should have kept all over five dollars, and\\npurchased herself shoes with it. \\'Oh, I do not want money or\\nclothes now, I only want my son; and if five dollars will get him,\\nmore will surely get him. \\' And if the lawyer had returned it to her,\\nshe avers she would not have accepted it. She was perfectly willing\\nhe should have every coin she could raise, if he would but restore\\nher lost son to her. Moreover, the five dollars he required were for\\nthe remuneration of him who should go after her son and his\\nmaster, and not for his own services.\\n\\nThe lawyer now renewed his promise, that she should have\\nher son in twenty-four hours. But Isabella, having no idea of this\\nspace of time, went several times in a day, to ascertain if her son\\nhad come. Once, when the servant opened the door and saw\\nher, she said, in a tone expressive of much surprise, \\'Why, this\\nwoman\\'s come again!\\' She then wondered if she went too\\noften. When the lawyer appeared, he told her the twenty-four\\nhours would not expire till the next morning; if she would call\\nthen, she would see her son. The next morning saw Isabel at the\\nlawyer\\'s door, while he was yet in his bed. He now assured her\\nit was morning till noon; and that before noon her son would\\nbe there, for he had sent the famous \\'Matty Styles\\' after him,\\nwho would not fail to have the boy and his master on hand in\\ndue season, either dead or alive; of that he was sure. Telling her\\nshe need not come again; he would himself inform her of their\\narrival.\\n\\nAfter dinner, he appeared at Mr. Rutzer\\'s, (a place the lawyer\\nhad procured for her, while she awaited the arrival of her boy,)\\nassuring her, her son had come; but that he stoutly denied having\\nany mother, or any relatives in that place; and said, \\'she must go\\nover and identify him.\\' She went to the office, but at sight of\\nher the boy cried aloud, and regarded her as some terrible being,\\nwho was about to take him away from a kind and loving friend.\\nHe knelt, even, and begged them, with tears, not to take him\\naway from his dear master, who had brought him from the\\ndreadful South, and been so kind to him.\\n\\nWhen he was questioned relative to the bad scar on his\\nforehead, he said, \\'Fowler\\'s horse hove him.\\' And of the one\\non his cheek, \\'That was done by running against the carriage.\\'\\nIn answering these questions, he looked imploringly at his master,\\nas much as to say, \\'If they are falsehoods, you bade me say\\nthem; may they be satisfactory to you, at least.\\'\\n\\nThe justice, noting his appearance, bade him forget his master\\nand attend only to him. But the boy persisted in denying his\\nmother, and clinging to his master, saying his mother did not live\\nin such a place as that. However, they allowed the mother to\\nidentify her son; and Esquire Demain pleaded that he claimed\\nthe boy for her, on the ground that he had been sold out of the\\nState, contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided-spoke of\\nthe penalties annexed to said crime, and of the sum of\\nmoney the delinquent was to pay, in case any one chose to\\nprosecute him for the offence he had committed. Isabella, who\\nwas sitting in a corner, scarcely daring to breathe, thought within\\nherself, \\'If I can but get the boy, the $200 may remain for\\nwhoever else chooses to prosecute-I have done enough to\\nmake myself enemies already\\'-and she trembled at the thought\\nof the formidable enemies she had probably arrayed against\\nherself-helpless and despised as she was. When the pleading\\nwas at an end, Isabella understood the Judge to declare, as the\\nsentence of the Court, that the \\'boy be delivered into the hands\\nof the mother-having no other master, no other controller, no\\nother conductor, but his mother.\\' This sentence was obeyed; he\\nwas delivered into her hands, the boy meanwhile begging, most\\npiteously, not to be taken from his dear master, saying she was\\nnot his mother, and that his mother did not live in such a place\\nas that. And it was some time before lawyer Demain, the clerks,\\nand Isabella, could collectively succeed in calming the child\\'s\\nfears, and in convincing him that Isabella was not some terrible\\nmonster, as he had for the last months, probably, been trained to\\nbelieve; and who, in taking him away from his master, was\\ntaking him from all good, and consigning him to all evil.\\n\\nWhen at last kind words and bon-bons had quieted his fears,\\nand he could listen to their explanations, he said to Isabella-\\n\\'Well, you do look like my mother used to\\'; and she was soon\\nable to make him comprehend some of the obligations he was\\nunder, and the relation he stood in, both to herself and his\\nmaster. She commenced as soon as practicable to examine the\\nboy, and found, to her utter astonishment, that from the crown\\nof his head to the sole of his foot, the callosities and indurations\\non his entire body were most frightful to behold. His back she\\ndescribed as being like her fingers, as she laid them side by side.\\n\\n\\'Heavens! what is all this? \\' said Isabel. He answered, \\'It is\\nwhere Fowler whipped, kicked, and beat me.\\' She exclaimed,\\n\\'Oh, Lord Jesus, look! see my poor child! Oh Lord, \"render\\nunto them double\" for all this! Oh my God! Pete, how did you\\nbear it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, this is nothing, mammy-if you should see Phillis, I\\nguess you\\'d scare! She had a little baby, and Fowler cut her till\\nthe milk as well as blood ran down her body. You would scare\\nto see Phillis, mammy.\\'\\n\\nWhen Isabella inquired, \\'What did Miss Eliza * say, Pete,\\nwhen you were treated so badly?\\' he replied, \\'Oh, mammy, she\\nsaid she wished I was with Bell. Sometimes I crawled under the\\nstoop, mammy, the blood running all about me, and my back\\nwould stick to the boards; and sometimes Miss Eliza would\\ncome and grease my sores, when all were abed and asleep.\\'\\n\\n\\nNote:\\n*Meaning Mrs. Eliza Fowler.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEATH OF MRS. ELIZA FOWLER.\\n\\n\\nAs soon as possible she procured a place for Peter, as tender of\\nlocks, at a place called Wahkendall, near Greenkills. After he\\nwas thus disposed of, she visited her sister Sophia, who resided\\nat Newberg, and spent the winter in several different families\\nwhere she was acquainted. She remained some time in the family\\nof a Mr. Latin, who was a relative of Solomon Gedney; and\\nthe latter, when he found Isabel with his cousin, used all his\\ninfluence to persuade him she was a great mischief-maker and a\\nvery troublesome person,-that she had put him to some hundreds\\nof dollars expense, by fabricating lies about him, and\\nespecially his sister and her family, concerning her boy, when the\\nlatter was living so like a gentleman with them; and, for his part,\\nhe would not advise his friends to harbor or encourage her.\\nHowever, his cousins, the Latins, could not see with the eyes of\\nhis feelings, and consequently his words fell powerless on them,\\nand they retained her in their service as long as they had aught\\nfor her to do.\\n\\nShe then went to visit her former master, Dumont. She had\\nscarcely arrived there, when Mr. Fred. Waring entered, and\\nseeing Isabel, pleasantly accosted her, and asked her \\'what she\\nwas driving at now-a-days.\\' On her answering \\'nothing particular,\\'\\nhe requested her to go over to his place, and assist his folks,\\nas some of them were sick, and they needed an extra hand. She\\nvery gladly assented. When Mr. W. retired, her master wanted\\nto know why she wished to help people, that called her the\\n\\'worst of devils,\\' as Mr. Waring had done in the courthouse-for he was\\nthe uncle of Solomon Gedney, and attended the trial\\nwe have described-and declared \\'that she was a fool to; he\\nwouldn\\'t do it.\\' \\'Oh,\\' she told him, \\'she would not mind that,\\nbut was very glad to have people forget their anger towards her.\\'\\nShe went over, but too happy to feel that their resentment was\\npassed, and commenced her work with a light heart and a strong\\nwill. She had not worked long in this frame of mind, before a\\nyoung daughter of Mr. Waring rushed into the rooms exclaiming,\\nwith uplifted hands-\\'Heavens and earth, Isabella! Fowler\\'s\\nmurdered Cousin Eliza!\\' \\'Ho,\\' said Isabel, \\'that\\'s nothing-he\\nliked to have killed my child; nothing saved him but God.\\'\\nMeaning, that she was not at all surprised at it, for a man whose\\nheart was sufficiently hardened to treat a mere child as hers had\\nbeen treated, was, in her opinion, more fiend than human, and\\nprepared for the commission of any crime that his passions might\\nprompt him to. The child further informed her that a letter had\\narrived by mail bringing the news.\\n\\nImmediately after this announcement, Solomon Gedney and\\nhis mother came in, going direct to Mrs. Waring\\'s room, where\\nshe soon heard tones as of some one reading. She thought\\nsomething said to her inwardly, \\'Go up stairs and hear.\\' At first\\nshe hesitated, but it seemed to press her the more-\\'Go up and\\nhear!\\' She went up, unusual as it is for slaves to leave their work\\nand enter unbidden their mistress\\'s room, for the sole purpose of\\nseeing or hearing what may be seen or heard there. But on this\\noccasion, Isabella says, she walked in at the door, shut it, placed\\nher back against it, and listened. She saw them and heard them\\nread-\\'He knocked her down with his fist, jumped on her with\\nhis knees, broke her collar-bone, and tore out her wind-pipe!\\nHe then attempted his escape, but was pursued and arrested, and\\nput in an iron bank for safe-keeping!\\' And the friends were\\nrequested to go down and take away the poor innocent children\\nwho had thus been made in one short day more than orphans.\\n\\nIf this narrative should ever meet the eye of those innocent\\nsufferers for another\\'s guilt, let them not be too deeply affected\\nby the relation; but, placing their confidence in Him who sees\\nthe end from the beginning, and controls the results, rest secure\\nin the faith, that, although they may physically suffer for the sins\\nof others, if they remain but true to themselves, their highest and\\nmore enduring interests can never suffer from such a cause. This\\nrelation should be suppressed for their sakes, were it not even\\nnow so often denied, that slavery is fast undermining all true\\nregard for human life. We know this one instance is not a\\ndemonstration to the contrary; but, adding this to the lists of\\ntragedies that weekly come up to us through the Southern mails,\\nmay we not admit them as proofs irrefragable? The newspapers\\nconfirmed this account of the terrible affair.\\n\\nWhen Isabella had heard the letter, all being too much absorbed\\nin their own feelings to take note of her, she returned to\\nher work, her heart swelling with conflicting emotions. She was\\nawed at the dreadful deed; she mourned the fate of the loved\\nEliza, who had in such an undeserved and barbarous manner\\nbeen put away from her labors and watchings as a tender mother;\\nand, \\'last though not least,\\' in the development of her character\\nand spirit, her heart bled for the afflicted relatives; even those of\\nthem who \\'laughed at her calamity, and mocked when her fear\\ncame.\\' Her thoughts dwelt long and intently on the subject, and\\nthe wonderful chain of events that had conspired to bring her\\nthat day to that house, to listen to that piece of intelligence-to that\\nhouse, where she never was before or afterwards in her\\nlife, and invited there by people who had so lately been hotly\\nincensed against her. It all seemed very remarkable to her, and\\nshe viewed it as flowing from a special providence of God. She\\nthought she saw clearly, that their unnatural bereavement was a\\nblow dealt in retributive justice; but she found it not in her heart\\nto exult or rejoice over them. She felt as if God had more than\\nanswered her petition, when she ejaculated, in her anguish of\\nmind, \\'Oh, Lord, render unto them double!\\' She said, \\'I dared\\nnot find fault with God, exactly; but the language of my heart\\nwas, \\'Oh, my God! that\\'s too much-I did not mean quite so\\nmuch, God!\\' It was a terrible blow to the friends of the deceased;\\nand her selfish mother (who, said Isabella, made such a\\n\\'to-do about her boy, not from affection, but to have her own\\nwill and way\\') went deranged, and walking to and fro in her\\ndelirium, called aloud for her poor murdered daughter-\\'Eliza!\\nEliza! \\'\\n\\nThe derangement of Mrs. G. was a matter of hearsay, as\\nIsabella saw her not after the trial; but she has no reason to doubt\\nthe truth of what she heard. Isabel could never learn the subsequent\\nfate of Fowler, but heard, in the spring of \\'49, that his\\nchildren had been seen in Kingston-one of whom was spoken\\nof as a fine, interesting girl, albeit a halo of sadness fell like a\\nveil\\nabout her.\\n\\n\\n\\nISABELLA\\'S RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.\\n\\n\\nWe will now turn from the outward and temporal to the inward\\nand spiritual life of our subject. It is ever both interesting and\\ninstructive to trace the exercises of a human mind, through the\\ntrials and mysteries of life; and especially a naturally powerful\\nmind, left as hers was almost entirely to its own workings, and\\nthe chance influences it met on its way; and especially to note\\nits reception of that divine \\'light, that lighteth every man that\\ncometh into the world.\\'\\n\\nWe see, as knowledge dawns upon it, truth and error\\nstrangely commingled; here, a bright spot illuminated by truth-and\\nthere, one darkened and distorted by error; and the state of\\nsuch a soul may be compared to a landscape at early dawn, where\\nthe sun is seen superbly gilding some objects, and causing others\\nto send forth their lengthened, distorted, and sometimes hideous\\nshadows.\\n\\nHer mother, as we have already said, talked to her of God.\\nFrom these conversations, her incipient mind drew the conclusion,\\nthat God was \\'a great man\\'; greatly superior to other men\\nin power; and being located \\'high in the sky,\\' could see all that\\ntranspired on the earth. She believed he not only saw, but noted\\ndown all her actions in a great book, even as her master kept a\\nrecord of whatever he wished not to forget. But she had no idea\\nthat God knew a thought of hers till she had uttered it aloud.\\n\\nAs we have before mentioned, she had ever been mindful of\\nher mother\\'s injunctions, spreading out in detail all her troubles\\nbefore God, imploring and firmly trusting him to send her\\ndeliverance from them. Whilst yet a child, she listened to a story\\nof a wounded soldier, left alone in the trail of a flying army,\\nhelpless and starving, who hardened the very ground about him\\nwith kneeling in his supplications to God for relief, until it\\narrived. From this narrative, she was deeply impressed with the\\nidea, that if she also were to present her petitions under the open\\ncanopy of heaven, speaking very loud, she should the more\\nreadily be heard; consequently, she sought a fitting spot for this,\\nher rural sanctuary. The place she selected, in which to offer up\\nher daily orisons, was a small island in a small stream, covered\\nwith large willow shrubbery, beneath which the sheep had made\\ntheir pleasant winding paths; and sheltering themselves from the\\nscorching rays of a noon-tide sun, luxuriated in the cool shadows\\nof the graceful willows, as they listened to the tiny falls of the\\nsilver waters. It was a lonely spot, and chosen by her for its\\nbeauty, its retirement, and because she thought that there, in the\\nnoise of those waters, she could speak louder to God, without\\nbeing overheard by any who might pass that way. When she had\\nmade choice of her sanctum, at a point of the island where the\\nstream met, after having been separated, she improved it by\\npulling away the branches of the shrubs from the centre, and\\nweaving them together for a wall on the outside, forming a\\ncircular arched alcove, made entirely of the graceful willow. To\\nthis place she resorted daily, and in pressing times much more\\nfrequently.\\n\\nAt this time, her prayers, or, more appropriately, \\'talks with\\nGod,\\' were perfectly original and unique, and would be well\\nworth preserving, were it possible to give the tones and manner\\nwith the words; but no adequate idea of them can be written\\nwhile the tones and manner remain inexpressible.\\n\\nShe would sometimes repeat, \\'Our Father in heaven,\\' in her\\nLow Dutch, as taught her by her mother; after that, all was from\\nthe suggestions of her own rude mind. She related to God, in\\nminute detail, all her troubles and sufferings, inquiring, as she\\nproceeded, \\'Do you think that\\'s right, God?\\' and closed by\\nbegging to be delivered from the evil, whatever it might be.\\n\\nShe talked to God as familiarly as if he had been a creature\\nlike herself; and a thousand times more so, than if she had been\\nin the presence of some earthly potentate. She demanded, with\\nlittle expenditure of reverence or fear, a supply of all her more\\npressing wants, and at times her demands approached very near\\nto commands. She felt as if God was under obligation to her,\\nmuch more than she was to him. He seemed to her benighted\\nvision in some manner bound to do her bidding.\\n\\nHer heart recoils now, with very dread, when she recalls\\nthose shocking, almost blasphemous conversations with great\\nJehovah. And well for herself did she deem it, that, unlike earthly\\npotentates, his infinite character combined the tender father\\nwith the omniscient and omnipotent Creator of the universe.\\n\\nShe at first commenced promising God, that if he would help\\nher out of all her difficulties, she would pay him by being very\\ngood; and this goodness she intended as a remuneration to God.\\nShe could think of no benefit that was to accrue to herself or her\\nfellow-creatures, from her leading a life of purity and generous\\nself-sacrifice for the good of others; as far as any but God was\\nconcerned, she saw nothing in it but heart-trying penance, sustained\\nby the sternest exertion; and this she soon found much\\nmore easily promised than performed.\\n\\nDays wore away-new trials came-God\\'s aid was invoked,\\nand the same promises repeated; and every successive night\\nfound her part of the contract unfulfilled. She now began to\\nexcuse herself, by telling God she could not be good in her\\npresent circumstances; but if he would give her a new place, and\\na good master and mistress, she could and would be good; and\\nshe expressly stipulated, that she would be good one day to show\\nGod how good she would be all of the time, when he should\\nsurround her with the right influences, and she should be delivered\\nfrom the temptations that then so sorely beset her. But, alas!\\nwhen night came, and she became conscious that she had yielded\\nto all her temptations, and entirely failed of keeping her word\\nwith God, having prayed and promised one hour, and fallen into\\nthe sins of anger and profanity the next, the mortifying reflection\\nweighed on her mind, and blunted her enjoyment. Still, she did\\nnot lay it deeply to heart, but continued to repeat her demands\\nfor aid, and her promises of pay, with full purpose of heart, at\\neach particular time, that that day she would not fail to keep her\\nplighted word.\\n\\nThus perished the inward spark, like a flame just igniting,\\nwhen one waits to see whether it will burn on or die out, till the\\nlong desired change came, and she found herself in a new place,\\nwith a good mistress, and one who never instigated an otherwise\\nkind master to be unkind to her; in short, a place where she had\\nliterally nothing to complain of, and where, for a time, she was\\nmore happy than she could well express. \\'Oh, every thing there\\nwas so pleasant, and kind, and good, and all so comfortable;\\nenough of every thing; indeed, it was beautiful!\\' she exclaimed.\\n\\nHere, at Mr. Van Wagener\\'s,-as the reader will readily\\nperceive she must have been,-she was so happy and satisfied,\\nthat God was entirely forgotten. Why should her thoughts turn\\nto him, who was only known to her as a help in trouble? She had\\nno trouble now; her every prayer had been answered in every\\nminute particular. She had been delivered from her persecutors\\nand temptations, her youngest child had been given her, and the\\nothers she knew she had no means of sustaining if she had them\\nwith her, and was content to leave them behind. Their father,\\nwho was much older than Isabel, and who preferred serving his\\ntime out in slavery, to the trouble and dangers of the course she\\npursued, remained with and could keep an eye on them-though it is\\ncomparatively little that they can do for each other\\nwhile they remain in slavery; and this little the slave, like persons\\nin every other situation of life, is not always disposed to perform.\\nThere are slaves, who, copying the selfishness of their superiors\\nin power, in their conduct towards their fellows who may be\\nthrown upon their mercy, by infirmity or illness, allow them to\\nsuffer for want of that kindness and care which it is fully in their\\npower to render them.\\n\\nThe slaves in this country have ever been allowed to celebrate\\nthe principal, if not some of the lesser festivals observed by\\nthe Catholics and Church of England;-many of them not being\\nrequired to do the least service for several days, and at Christmas\\nthey have almost universally an entire week to themselves, except,\\nperhaps, the attending to a few duties, which are absolutely\\nrequired for the comfort of the families they belong to. If much\\nservice is desired, they are hired to do it, and paid for it as if they\\nwere free. The more sober portion of them spend these holidays\\nin earning a little money. Most of them visit and attend parties\\nand balls, and not a few of them spend it in the lowest dissipation.\\nThis respite from toil is granted them by all religionists, of\\nwhatever persuasion, and probably originated from the fact that\\nmany of the first slaveholders were members of the Church of\\nEngland.\\n\\nFrederick Douglass, who has devoted his great heart and\\nnoble talents entirely to the furtherance of the cause of his\\ndown-trodden race, has said-\\'From what I know of the effect\\nof their holidays upon the slave, I believe them to be among the\\nmost effective means, in the hands of the slaveholder, in keeping\\ndown the spirit of insurrection. Were the slaveholders at once to\\nabandon this practice, I have not the slightest doubt it would\\nlead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves. These holidays\\nserve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious\\nspirit of enslaved humanity. But for these, the slave would\\nbe forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the\\nslaveholder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation\\nof those conductors! I warn him that, in such an event, a\\nspirit will go forth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the\\nmost appalling earthquake.\\'\\n\\nWhen Isabella had been at Mr. Van Wagener\\'s a few months,\\nshe saw in prospect one of the festivals approaching. She knows\\nit by none but the Dutch name, Pingster, as she calls it-but\\nI think it must have been Whitsuntide, in English. She says she\\n\\'looked back into Egypt,\\' and every thing looked \\'so pleasant\\nthere,\\' as she saw retrospectively all her former companions\\nenjoying their freedom for at least a little space, as well as their\\nwonted convivialities, and in her heart she longed to be with\\nthem. With this picture before her mind\\'s eye, she contrasted the\\nquiet, peaceful life she was living with the excellent people of\\nWahkendall, and it seemed so dull and void of incident, that the\\nvery contrast served but to heighten her desire to return, that, at\\nleast, she might enjoy with them, once more, the coming festivities.\\nThese feelings had occupied a secret corner of her breast for\\nsome time, when, one morning, she told Mrs. Van Wagener that\\nher old master Dumont would come that day, and that she\\nshould go home with him on his return. They expressed some\\nsurprise, and asked her where she obtained her information. She\\nreplied, that no one had told her, but she felt that he would\\ncome.\\n\\nIt seemed to have been one of those \\'events that cast their\\nshadows before\\'; for, before night, Mr. Dumont made his appearance.\\nShe informed him of her intention to accompany him\\nhome. He answered, with a smile, \\'I shall not take you back\\nagain; you ran away from me.\\' Thinking his manner contradicted\\nhis words, she did not feel repulsed, but made herself and\\nchild ready; and when her former master had seated himself in\\nthe open dearborn, she walked towards it, intending to place\\nherself and child in the rear, and go with him. But, ere she\\nreached the vehicle, she says that God revealed himself to her,\\nwith all the suddenness of a flash of lightning, showing her, \\'in\\nthe twinkling of an eye, that he was all over\\'-that he pervaded\\nthe universe-\\'and that there was no place where God was\\nnot.\\' She became instantly conscious of her great sin in forgetting\\nher almighty Friend and \\'ever-present help in time of\\ntrouble.\\' All her unfulfilled promises arose before her, like a\\nvexed sea whose waves run mountains high; and her soul, which\\nseemed but one mass of lies, shrunk back aghast from the \\'awful\\nlook\\' of him whom she had formerly talked to, as if he had been\\na being like herself; and she would now fain have hid herself in\\nthe bowels of the earth, to have escaped his dread presence. But\\nshe plainly saw there was no place, not even in hell, where he\\nwas not; and where could she flee? Another such \\'a look,\\' as she\\nexpressed it, and she felt that she must be extinguished forever,\\neven as one, with the breath of his mouth, \\'blows out a lamp,\\'\\nso that no spark remains.\\n\\nA dire dread of annihilation now seized her, and she waited\\nto see if, by \\'another look,\\' she was to be stricken from\\nexistence,-swallowed\\nup, even as the fire licketh up the oil with\\nwhich it comes in contact.\\n\\nWhen at last the second look came not, and her attention was\\nonce more called to outward things, she observed her master had\\nleft, and exclaiming aloud, \\'Oh, God, I did not know you were\\nso big,\\' walked into the house, and made an effort to resume her\\nwork. But the workings of the inward man were too absorbing\\nto admit of much attention to her avocations. She desired to\\ntalk to God, but her vileness utterly forbade it, and she was not\\nable to prefer a petition. \\'What!\\' said she, \\'shall I lie again to\\nGod? I have told him nothing but lies; and shall I speak again,\\nand tell another lie to God?\\' She could not; and now she began\\nto wish for some one to speak to God for her. Then a space\\nseemed opening between her and God, and she felt that if some\\none, who was worthy in the sight of heaven, would but plead\\nfor her in their own name, and not let God know it came from\\nher, who was so unworthy, God might grant it. At length a\\nfriend appeared to stand between herself and an insulted Deity;\\nand she felt as sensibly refreshed as when, on a hot day, an\\numbrella had been interposed between her scorching head and\\na burning sun. But who was this friend? became the next inquiry.\\nWas it Deencia, who had so often befriended her? She\\nlooked at her, with her new power of sight-and, lo! she, too,\\nseemed all \\'bruises and putrifying sores,\\' like herself. No, it was\\nsome one very different from Deencia.\\n\\n\\'Who are you?\\' she exclaimed, as the vision brightened into\\na form distinct, beaming with the beauty of holiness, and radiant\\nwith love. She then said, audibly addressing the mysterious visitant-\\'I\\n\\nknow you, and I don\\'t know you.\\' Meaning, \\'You\\nseem perfectly familiar; I feel that you not only love me, but that\\nyou always have loved me-yet I know you not-I cannot call\\nyou by name.\\' When she said, \\'I know you,\\' the subject of the\\nvision remained distinct and quiet. When she said, \\'I don\\'t\\nknow you,\\' it moved restlessly about, like agitated waters. So\\nwhile she repeated, without intermission, \\'I know you, I know\\nyou,\\' that the vision might remain-\\'Who are you?\\' was the\\ncry of her heart, and her whole soul was in one deep prayer that\\nthis heavenly personage might be revealed to her, and remain\\nwith her. At length, after bending both soul and body with the\\nintensity of this desire, till breath and strength seemed failing,\\nand she could maintain her position no\\n\\nlonger, an answer came to her, saying distinctly, \\'It is Jesus.\\'\\n\\'Yes,\\' she responded, \\'it is Jesus.\\'\\n\\nPrevious to these exercises of mind, she heard Jesus mentioned in\\nreading or speaking, but had received from what she heard no impression\\nthat he was any other than an eminent man, like a Washington or a\\nLafayette.  Now he appeared to her delighted mental vision as so mild,\\nso good, and so every way lovely, and he loved her so much!  And, how\\nstrange that he had always loved her, and she had never known it!  And\\nhow great a blessing he conferred, in that he should stand between her\\nand God! And God was no longer a terror and a dread to her.\\n\\nShe stopped not to argue the point, even in her own mind, whether he\\nhad reconciled her to God, or God to herself, (though she thinks the\\nformer now,) being but\\n\\ntoo happy that God was no longer to her as a consuming fire, and Jesus\\nwas \\'altogether lovely.\\'  Her heart was now full of joy and gladness,\\nas it had been of terror, and at one time of despair.  In the light of\\nher great happiness, the world was clad in new beauty, the very air\\nsparkled as with diamonds, and was redolent of heaven.  She\\ncontemplated the unapproachable barriers that existed between herself\\nand the great of this world, as the world calls greatness, and made\\nsurprising comparisons between them, and the union existing between\\nherself and Jesus-Jesus, the transcendently lovely as well as great and\\npowerful; for so he appeared to her, though he seemed but human; and\\nshe watched for his bodily appearance, feeling that she should know\\nhim, if she saw him; and when he came, she would go and dwell with him,\\nas with a dear friend.\\n\\nIt was not given to her to see that he loved any other; and she thought\\nif others came to know and love him, as she did, she should be thrust\\naside and forgotten, being herself but a poor ignorant slave, with\\nlittle to recommend her to his notice.  And when she heard him spoken\\noff, she said mentally-\\'What! others know Jesus!  I thought no one knew\\nJesus but me!\\' and she felt a sort of jealousy, lest she should be\\nrobbed of her newly found treasure.\\n\\nShe conceived, one day, as she listened to reading, that she heard an\\nintimation that Jesus was married, and hastily inquired if Jesus had a\\nwife.  \\'What!\\' said the reader, \\'God have a wife?\\'  \\'Is Jesus God? \\'\\ninquired Isabella.  \\'Yes, to be sure he is,\\' was the answer returned.\\nFrom this time, her conceptions of Jesus became more elevated and\\nspiritual; and she sometimes spoke of him as God, in accordance with\\nthe teaching she had received.\\n\\nBut when she was simply told, that the Christian world was much divided\\non the subject of Christ\\'s nature-some believing him to be coequal with\\nthe Father-to be God in and of himself, \\'very God, of very God;\\'-some,\\nthat he is the \\'well-beloved,\\' \\'only begotten Son of God;\\'-and others,\\nthat he is, or was, rather, but a mere man-she said, \\'Of that I only\\nknow as I saw.  I did not see him to be God; else, how could he stand\\nbetween me and God?  I saw him as a friend, standing between me and\\nGod, through whom, love flowed as from a fountain.\\'  Now, so far from\\nexpressing her views of Christ\\'s character and office in accordance\\nwith any system of theology extant, she says she believes Jesus is the\\nsame spirit that was in our first parents, Adam and Eve, in the\\nbeginning, when they came from the hand of their Creator.  When they\\nsinned through disobedience, this pure spirit forsook them, and fled to\\nheaven; that there it remained, until it returned again in the person\\nof Jesus; and that, previous to a personal union with him, man is but a\\nbrute, possessing only the spirit of an animal.\\n\\nShe avers that, in her darkest hours, she had no fear of any worse hell\\nthan the one she then carried in her bosom; though it had ever been\\npictured to her in its deepest colors, and threatened her as a reward\\nfor all her misdemeanors.  Her vileness and God\\'s holiness and\\nall-pervading presence, which filled immensity, and threatened her with\\nconstant annihilation, composed the burden of her vision of terror.\\nHer faith in prayer is equal to her faith in the love of Jesus. Her\\nlanguage is, \\'Let others say what they will of the efficacy of prayer,\\nI believe in it, and I shall pray.  Thank God!  Yes, I shall always\\npray,\\' she exclaims, putting her hands together with the greatest\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\nFor some time subsequent to the happy change we\\nhave spoken off, Isabella\\'s prayers partook largely of their former\\ncharacter; and while, in deep affliction, she labored for the recovery\\nof her son, she prayed with constancy and fervor; and the following may\\nbe taken as a specimen:-\\'Oh,\\nGod, you know how much I am distressed, for I have told you again and\\nagain.  Now, God, help me get my son.  If you were in trouble, as I am,\\nand I could help you, as you can me, think I would n\\'t do it?  Yes,\\nGod, you know I would do it.\\'\\n\\'Oh, God, you know I have no money, but you can make the people do for\\nme, and you must make the people do for me.  I will never give you\\npeace till you do, God.\\'\\n\\'Oh, God, make the people hear me-don\\'t let them turn me off, without\\nhearing and helping me.\\'\\nAnd she has not a particle of doubt, that God heard her, and especially\\ndisposed the hearts of thoughtless clerks, eminent lawyers, and grave\\njudges and others-between whom and herself there seemed to her almost\\nan infinite remove-to listen to her suit with patient and respectful\\nattention, backing it up with all needed aid.  The sense of her\\nnothingness in the eyes of those with whom she contended for her\\nrights, sometimes fell on her like a heavy weight, which nothing but\\nher unwavering confidence in an arm which she believed to be stronger\\nthan all others combined could have raised from her sinking spirit.\\n\\'Oh! how little did I feel,\\' she repeated, with a powerful emphasis.\\n\\'Neither would you wonder, if you could have seen me, in my ignorance\\nand destitution, trotting about the streets, meanly clad, bare-headed,\\nand bare-footed!  Oh, God only could have made such people hear me; and\\nhe did it in answer to my prayers.\\'  And this perfect trust, based on\\nthe rock of Deity, was a soul-protecting fortress, which, raising her\\nabove the battlements of fear, and shielding her from the machinations\\nof the enemy, impelled her onward in the struggle, till the foe was\\nvanquished, and the victory gained.\\n\\nWe have now seen Isabella, her youngest daughter, and her only son, in\\npossession of, at least, their nominal freedom.  It has been said that\\nthe freedom of the most free of the colored people of this country is\\nbut nominal; but stinted and limited as it is, at best, it is an\\nimmense remove from chattel slavery.  This fact is disputed, I know;\\nbut I have no confidence in the honesty of such questionings.  If they\\nare made in sincerity, I honor not the judgment that thus decides.\\n\\nHer husband, quite advanced in age, and infirm of health, was\\nemancipated, with the balance of the adult slaves of the State,\\naccording to law, the following summer, July 4, 1828.\\n\\nFor a few years after this event, he was able to earn a scanty living,\\nand when he failed to do that, he was dependent on the \\'world\\'s cold\\ncharity,\\' and died in a poorhouse.  Isabella had herself and two\\nchildren to provide for; her wages were trifling, for at that time the\\nwages of females were at a small advance from nothing; and she\\ndoubtless had to learn the first elements of economy-for what slaves,\\nthat were never allowed to make any stipulations or calculations for\\nthemselves, ever possessed an adequate idea of the true value of time,\\nor, in fact, of any material thing in the universe?  To such, \\'prudent\\nusing\\' is meanness-and \\'saving\\' is a word to be sneered at.  Of course,\\nit was not in her power to make to herself a home, around whose sacred\\nhearth-stone she could collect her family, as they gradually emerged\\nfrom their prison-house of bondage; a home, where she could cultivate\\ntheir affection, administer to\\ntheir wants, and instil into the opening minds of her children those\\nprinciples of virtue, and that love of purity, truth and benevolence,\\nwhich must for ever form the foundation of a life of usefulness and\\nhappiness.  No-all this was far beyond her power or means, in more\\nsenses than one; and it should be taken into the account, whenever a\\ncomparison is instituted between the progress made by her children in\\nvirtue and goodness, and the progress of those who have been nurtured\\nin the genial warmth of a sunny home, where good influences cluster,\\nand bad ones are carefully excluded-where \\'line upon line, and precept\\nupon precept,\\' are daily brought to their quotidian tasks-and where, in\\nshort, every appliance is brought in requisition, that self-denying\\nparents can bring to bear on one of the dearest objects of a parent\\'s\\nlife, the promotion of the welfare of their children.  But God forbid\\nthat this suggestion should be wrested from its original intent, and\\nmade to shield any one from merited rebuke!  Isabella\\'s children are\\nnow of an age to know good from evil, and may easily inform themselves\\non any point where they may yet be in doubt; and if they now suffer\\nthemselves to be drawn by temptation into the paths of the destroyer,\\nor forget what is due to the mother who has done and suffered so much\\nfor them, and who, now that she is descending into the vale of years,\\nand feels her health and strength declining, will turn her expecting\\neyes to them for aid and comfort, just as instinctively as the child\\nturns its confiding eye to its fond parent, when it seeks for succor or\\nsympathy-(for it is now their turn to do the work, and bear the burdens\\nof life, so all must bear them in turn, as the wheel of life rolls on)-\\nif, I say, they forget this, their duty and their happiness, and pursue\\nan opposite course of sin and folly, they must lose the respect of the\\nwise and good, and find, when too late, that \\'the way of the\\ntransgressor is hard.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nNEW TRIALS.\\n\\n\\nThe reader will pardon this passing homily, while we return to our\\nnarrative.\\n\\nWe were saying that the day-dreams of Isabella and her husband-the plan\\nthey drew of what they would do, and the comforts they thought to have,\\nwhen they should obtain their freedom, and a little home of their own-\\nhad all turned to \\'thin air,\\' by the postponement of their freedom to\\nso late a day.  These delusive hopes were never to be realized, and a\\nnew set of trials was gradually to open before her.  These were the\\nheart-wasting trials of watching over her children, scattered, and\\nimminently exposed to the temptations of the adversary, with few, if\\nany, fixed principles to sustain them.\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' she says, \\'how little did I know myself of the best way to\\ninstruct and counsel them!  Yet I did the best I then knew, when with\\nthem.  I took them to the religious meetings; I talked to, and prayed\\nfor and with them; when they did wrong, I scolded at and whipped them.\\'\\n\\nIsabella and her son had been free about a year, when they went to\\nreside in the city of New York; a place which she would doubtless have\\navoided, could she have foreseen what was there in store for her; for\\nthis view into the future would have taught her what she only learned\\nby bitter experience, that the baneful influences going up from such a\\ncity were not the best helps to education, commenced as the education\\nof her children had been.\\n\\nHer son Peter was, at the time of which we are speaking, just at that\\nage when no lad should be subjected to the temptations of such a place,\\nunprotected as he was, save by the feeble arm of a mother, herself a\\nservant there.  He was growing up to be a tall, well-formed, active\\nlad, of quick perceptions, mild and cheerful in his disposition, with\\nmuch that was open, generous and winning about him, but with little\\npower to withstand temptation, and a ready ingenuity to provide himself\\nwith ways and means to carry out his plans, and conceal from his mother\\nand her friends, all such as he knew would not meet their approbation.\\nAs will be readily believed, he was soon drawn into a circle of\\nassociates who did not improve either his habits or his morals.\\n\\nTwo years passed before Isabella knew what character Peter was\\nestablishing for himself among his low and worthless comrades-passing\\nunder the assumed name of Peter Williams; and she began to feel a\\nparent\\'s pride in the promising appearance of her only son.  But, alas!\\nthis pride and pleasure were shortly dissipated, as distressing facts\\nrelative to him came one by one to her astonished ear.  A friend of\\nIsabella\\'s, a lady, who was much pleased with the good humor,\\ningenuity, and open confessions of Peter, when driven into a corner,\\nand who, she said, \\'was so smart, he ought to have an education, if any\\none ought,\\'-paid ten dollars, as tuition fee, for him to attend a\\nnavigation school.  But Peter, little inclined to spend his leisure\\nhours in study, when he might be enjoying himself in the dance, or\\notherwise, with his boon companions, went regularly and made some\\nplausible excuses to the teacher, who received them as genuine, along\\nwith the ten dollars of Mrs -, and while his mother and her friend\\nbelieved him improving at school, he was, to their latent sorrow,\\nimproving in a very different place or places, and on entirely opposite\\nprinciples.  They also procured him an excellent place as a coachman.\\nBut, wanting money, he sold his livery, and other things belonging to\\nhis master; who, having conceived a kind regard for him, considered his\\nyouth, and prevented the law from falling, with all its rigor, upon his\\nhead.  Still he continued to abuse his privileges, and to involve\\nhimself in repeated difficulties, from which his mother as often\\nextricated him.   At each time, she talked much, and reasoned and\\nremonstrated with him; and he would, with such perfect frankness, lay\\nopen his whole soul to her, telling her he had never intended doing\\nharm,-how he had been led along, little by little, till, before he was\\naware, he found himself in trouble-how he had tried to be good-and how,\\nwhen he would have been so, \\'evil was present with him,\\'-indeed he knew\\nnot how it was.\\n\\nHis mother, beginning to feel that the city was no place for him, urged\\nhis going to sea, and would have shipped him on board a man-of-war; but\\nPeter was not disposed to consent to that proposition, while the city\\nand its pleasures were accessible to him.  Isabella now became a prey\\nto distressing fears, dreading lest the next day or hour come fraught\\nwith the report of some dreadful crime, committed or abetted by her\\nson.  She thanks the Lord for sparing her that giant sorrow, as all his\\nwrong doings never ranked higher, in the eye of the law, than\\nmisdemeanors.  But as she could see no improvement in Peter, as a last\\nresort, she resolved to leave him, for a time, unassisted, to bear the\\npenalty of his conduct, and see what effect that would have on him.  In\\nthe trial hour, she remained firm in her resolution.  Peter again fell\\ninto the hands of the police, and sent for his mother, as usual; but\\nshe went not to his relief.  In his extremity, he sent for Peter\\nWilliams, a respectable colored barber, whose name he had been\\nwearing, and who sometimes helped young culprits out of their troubles,\\nand sent them from city dangers, by shipping them on board of whaling\\nvessels.\\n\\nThe curiosity of this man was awakened by the culprit\\'s bearing his own\\nname.  He went to the Tombs and inquired into his case, but could not\\nbelieve what Peter told him respecting his mother and family.  Yet he\\nredeemed him, and Peter promised to leave New York in a vessel that was\\nto sail in the course of a week.  He went to see his mother, and\\ninformed her of what had happened to him.  She listened incredulously,\\nas to an idle tale.  He asked her to go with him and see for herself.\\nShe went, giving no credence to his story till she found herself in the\\npresence of Mr. Williams, and heard him saying to her, \\'I am very glad\\nI have assisted your son; he stood in great need of sympathy and\\nassistance; but I could not think he had such a mother here, although\\nhe assured me he had.\\'\\n\\nIsabella\\'s great trouble now was, a fear lest her son should deceive\\nhis benefactor, and be missing when the vessel sailed; but he begged\\nher earnestly to trust him, for he said he had resolved to do better,\\nand meant to abide by the resolve.  Isabella\\'s heart gave her no peace\\ntill the time of sailing, when Peter sent Mr. Williams and another\\nmessenger whom she knew, to tell her he had sailed.  But for a month\\nafterwards, she looked to see him emerging from some by-place in the\\ncity, and appearing before her; so afraid was she that he was still\\nunfaithful, and doing wrong.  But he did not appear, and at length she\\nbelieved him really gone.  He left in the summer of 1839, and his\\nfriends heard nothing further from him till his mother received the\\nfollowing letter, dated \\'October 17 1840\\';-\\n\\n\\n\\nMY DEAR AND BELOVED MOTHER:\\n\\n\\'I take this opportunity to write to you and inform you that I am well,\\nand in hopes for to find you the same.

This is the\\nfifth letter that I have wrote to you, and have received no answer, and\\nit makes me very uneasy.  So pray write as quick as you can, and tell\\nme how all the people is about the neighborhood.  We are out from home\\ntwenty-three months, and in hope to be home in fifteen months.  I have\\nnot much to say; but tell me if you have been up home since I left or\\nnot.  I want to know what sort of a time is at home.  We had very bad\\nluck when we first came out, but since we have had very good; so I am\\nin hopes to do well yet; but if I do n\\'t do well, you need not expect\\nme home these five years.  So write as quick as you can, won\\'t you?  So\\nnow I am going to put an end to my writing, at present.  Notice-when\\nthis you see, remember me, and place me in your mind.\\n\\nGet me to my home, that\\'s in the far distant west,\\nTo the scenes of my childhood, that I like the best;\\nThere the tall cedars grow, and the bright waters flow,\\nWhere my parents will greet me, white man, let me go!\\nLet me go to the spot where the cateract plays,\\nWhere oft I have sported in my boyish days;\\nAnd there is my poor mother, whose heart ever flows,\\nAt the sight of her poor child, to her let me go, let me go!\\n\\n\\n\\'Your only son,\\n\\'PETER VAN WAGENER.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nSince the date of the last letter, Isabella has heard no tidings from\\nher long-absent son, though ardently does her mother\\'s heart long for\\nsuch tidings, as her thoughts follow him around the world, in his\\nperilous vocation, saying within herself-\\'He is good now, I have no\\ndoubt; I feel sure that he has persevered, and kept the resolve he made\\nbefore he left home;-he seemed so different before he went, so\\ndetermined to do better.\\'  His letters are inserted here for\\npreservation, in case they prove the last she ever hears from him in\\nthis world.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINDING A BROTHER AND SISTER.\\n\\n\\nWhen Isabella had obtained the freedom of her son, she remained in\\nKingston, where she had been drawn by the judicial process, about a\\nyear, during which time she became a member of the Methodist Church\\nthere: and when she went to New York, she took a letter missive from\\nthat church to the Methodist Church in John street.\\nAfterwards, she withdrew her connection with that church, and joined\\nZion\\'s Church in Church street, composed entirely of colored people.\\nWith the latter church she remained until she went to reside with Mr.\\nPierson, after which, she was gradually drawn into the \\'kingdom\\' set up\\nby the prophet Matthias, in the name of God the Father; for he said the\\nspirit of God the Father dwelt in him.\\n\\nWhile Isabella was in New York, her sister Sophia came from Newburg to\\nreside in the former place.  Isabel had been favored with occasional\\ninterviews with this sister, although at one time she lost sight of her\\nfor the space of seventeen years-almost the entire period of her being\\nat Mr. Dumont\\'s-and when she appeared before her again, handsomely\\ndressed, she did not recognize her, till informed who she was.  Sophia\\ninformed her that her brother Michael-a brother she had never seen-was\\nin the city; and when she introduced him to Isabella, he informed her\\nthat their sister Nancy had been living in the city, and had deceased a\\nfew months before.  He described her features, her dress, her manner,\\nand said she had for some time been a member in Zion\\'s Church, naming\\nthe class she belonged to. Isabella almost instantly recognized her as\\na sister in the church, with whom she had knelt at the altar, and with\\nwhom she had exchanged the speaking pressure of the hand, in\\nrecognition of their spiritual sisterhood; little thinking, at the\\ntime, that they were also children of the same earthly parents-even\\nBomefree and Mau-mau Bett. As inquiries and answers rapidly passed, and\\nthe conviction deepened that this was their sister, the very sister\\nthey had heard so much of, but had never seen, (for she was the\\nself-same sister that had been locked in the great old fashioned\\nsleigh-box, when she was taken away, never to behold her mother\\'s face\\nagain this side the spirit-land, and Michael, the narrator, was the\\nbrother who had shared her fate,) Isabella thought, \\'D-h! here she was;\\nwe met; and was I not, at the time, struck with the peculiar feeling of\\nher hand-the bony hardness so just like mine? and yet I could not know\\nshe was my sister; and now I see she looked so like my mother.\\'  And\\nIsabella wept, and not alone; Sophia wept, and the strong man,\\nMichael, mingled his tears with theirs.  \\'Oh Lord,\\' inquired Isabella,\\n\\'what is this slavery, that it can do such dreadful things?  what evil\\ncan it not do?\\'  Well may she ask, for surely the evils it can and does\\ndo, daily and hourly, can never be summed up, till we can see them as\\nthey are recorded by him who writes no errors, and reckons without\\nmistake.  This account, which now varies so widely in the estimate of\\ndifferent minds, will be viewed alike by all.\\n\\nThink you, dear reader, when that day comes, the most \\'rapid\\nabolitionist\\' will say-\\'Behold, I saw all this while on the earth?\\'\\nWill he not rather say, \\'Oh, who has conceived the breadth and depth of\\nthis moral malaria, this putrescent plague-spot?\\'  Perhaps the pioneers\\nin the slave\\'s cause will be as much surprised as any to find that with\\nall their looking, there remained so much unseen.\\n\\n\\n\\nGLEANINGS.\\n\\n\\nThere are some hard things that crossed Isabella\\'s life while in\\nslavery, that she has no desire to publish, for various reasons.\\nFirst, because the parties from whose hands she suffered them have\\nrendered up their account to a higher tribunal, and their innocent\\nfriends alone are living, to have their feelings injured by the\\nrecital; secondly, because they are not all for the public ear, from\\ntheir very nature; thirdly, and not least, because, she says, were she\\nto tell all that happened to her as a slave-all that she knows is\\n\\'God\\'s truth\\'-it would seem to others, especially the uninitiated, so\\nunaccountable, so unreasonable, and what is usually called so\\nunnatural, (though it may be questioned whether people do not always\\nact naturally,) they would not easily believe it. \\'Why, no!\\' she says,\\n\\'they\\'d call me a liar! they would, indeed! and I do not wish to say\\nanything to destroy my own character for veracity, though what I say is\\nstrictly true.\\'  Some things have been omitted through forgetfulness,\\nwhich not having been mentioned in their places, can only be briefly\\nspoken of here;-such as, that her father Bomefree had had two wives\\nbefore he took Mau mau Bett; one of whom, if not both, were torn from\\nhim by the iron hand of the ruthless trafficker in human flesh;-that\\nher husband, Thomas, after one of his wives had been sold away from\\nhim, ran away to New York City, where he remained a year or two, before\\nhe was discovered and taken back to the prison-house of slavery;-that\\nher master Dumont, when he promised Isabella one year of her time,\\nbefore the State should make her free, made the same promise to her\\nhusband, and in addition to freedom, they were promised a log cabin for\\na home of their own; all of which, with the one-thousand-and-one\\nday-dreams resulting therefrom, went into the repository of unfulfilled\\npromises and unrealized hopes;-that she had often heard her father\\nrepeat a thrilling story of a little slave-child, which, because it\\nannoyed the family with its cries, was caught up by a white man, who\\ndashed its brains out against the wall.  An Indian (for Indians were\\nplenty in that region then) passed along as the bereaved mother washed\\nthe bloody corpse of her murdered child, and learning the cause of its\\ndeath, said, with characteristic vehemence, \\'If I had been here, I\\nwould have put my tomahawk in his head!\\' meaning the murderer\\'s.\\n\\nOf the cruelty of one Hasbrouck.-He had a sick slave-woman, who was\\nlingering with a slow consumption, whom he made to spin, regardless of\\nher weakness and suffering; and this woman had a child, that was unable\\nto walk or talk, at the age of five years, neither could it cry like\\nother children, but made a constant, piteous moaning sound.  This\\nexhibition of helplessness and imbecility, instead of exciting the\\nmaster\\'s pity, stung his cupidity, and so enraged him, that he would\\nkick the poor thing about like a foot-ball.\\n\\nIsabella\\'s informant had seen this brute of a man, when the child was\\ncurled up under a chair, innocently amusing itself with a few sticks,\\ndrag it hence, that he might have the pleasure of tormenting it.  She\\nhad see him, with one blow of his foot, send it rolling quite across\\nthe room, and down the steps at the door.  Oh, how she wished it might\\ninstantly die!  \\'But,\\' she said, \\'it seemed as tough as a moccasin.\\'\\nThough it did die at last, and made glad the heart of its friends; and\\nits persecutor, no doubt, rejoiced with them, but from very different\\nmotives.  But the day of his retribution was not far off-for he\\nsickened, and his reason fled.  It was fearful to hear his old slave\\nsoon tell how, in the day of his calamity, she treated him.\\n\\nShe was very strong, and was therefore selected to support her master,\\nas he sat up in bed, by putting her arms around, while she stood behind\\nhim.  It was then that she\\ndid her best to wreak her vengeance on him.  She would clutch his\\nfeeble frame in her iron grasp, as in a vice; and, when her mistress\\ndid not see, would give him a squeeze, a shake, and lifting him up, set\\nhim down again, as hard as possible.  If his breathing betrayed too\\ntight a grasp, and her mistress said, \\'Be careful, don\\'t hurt him,\\nSoan!\\' her every-ready answer was, \\'Oh no, Missus, no,\\' in her most\\npleasant tone-and then, as soon as Missus\\'s eyes and ears were engaged\\naway, another grasp-another shake-another bounce.  She was afraid the\\ndisease alone would let him recover,-an event she dreaded more than to\\ndo wrong herself.  Isabella asked her, if she were not afraid his\\nspirit would haunt her.  \\'Oh, no,\\' says Soan; \\'he was so wicked, the\\ndevil will never let him out of hell long enough for that.\\'\\n\\nMany slaveholders boast of the love of their slaves.  How would it\\nfreeze the blood of some of them to know what kind of love rankles in\\nthe bosoms of slaves for them!  Witness the attempt to poison Mrs.\\nCalhoun, and hundreds of similar cases.  Most \\'surprising \\' to every\\nbody, because committed by slaves supposed to be so grateful for their\\nchains.\\n\\nThese reflections bring to mind a discussion on this point, between the\\nwriter and a slaveholding friend in Kentucky, on Christmas morning,\\n1846.  We had asserted, that until mankind were far in advance of what\\nthey are now, irresponsible power over our fellow-beings would be, as\\nit is, abused.  Our friend declared it was his conviction, that the\\ncruelties of slavery existed chiefly in imagination, and that no person\\nin D- County, where we then were, but would be above ill-treating a\\nhelpless slave.  We answered, that if his belief was well-founded, the\\npeople in Kentucky were greatly in advance of the people of New\\nEngland-for we would not dare say as much as that of any\\nschool-district there, letting alone counties.  No, we would not\\nanswer for our own conduct even on so delicate a point.\\n\\nThe next evening, he very magnanimously overthrew his own position and\\nestablished ours, by informing us that, on the morning previous, and as\\nnear as we could learn, at the very hour in which we were earnestly\\ndiscussing the probabilities of the case, a young woman of fine\\nappearance, and high standing in society, the pride of her husband, and\\nthe mother of an infant daughter, only a few miles from us, ay, in D-\\nCounty, too, was actually beating in the skull of a slave-woman called\\nTabby; and not content with that, had her tied up and whipped, after\\nher skull was broken, and she died hanging to the bedstead, to which\\nshe had been fastened.  When informed that Tabby was\\ndead, she answered, \\'I am glad of it, for she has worried my life out\\nof me.\\'  But Tabby\\'s highest good was probably not the end proposed by\\nMrs. M-, for no one supposed she meant to kill her.  Tabby was\\nconsidered quite lacking in good sense, and no doubt belonged to that\\nclass at the South, that are silly enough to \\'die of moderate\\ncorrection.\\'\\n\\n\\nA mob collected around the house for an hour or two, in that manner\\nexpressing a momentary indignation.  But was she treated as a\\nmurderess?  Not at all!  She was allowed to take boat (for her\\nresidence was near the beautiful Ohio) that evening, to spend a few\\nmonths with her absent friends, after which she returned and remained\\nwith her husband, no one to \\'molest or make her afraid.\\'\\n\\n\\nHad she been left to the punishment of an outraged conscience from\\nright motives, I would have \\'rejoiced with exceeding joy\\'.  But to see\\nthe life of one woman, and she a murderess, put in the balance against\\nthe lives of three millions of innocent slaves, and to contrast her\\npunishment with what I felt would be the punishment of one who was\\nmerely suspected of being an equal friend of all mankind, regardless of\\ncolor or condition, caused my blood to stir within me, and my heart to\\nsicken at the thought.  The husband of Mrs. M- was absent from home, at\\nthe time alluded to; and when he arrived, some weeks afterwards,\\nbringing beautiful presents to his cherished companion, he beheld his\\nonce happy home deserted, Tabby murdered and buried in the garden, and\\nthe wife of his bosom, and the mother of his child, the doer of a\\ndreadful deed, a murderess!\\n\\n\\nWhen Isabella went to New York City, she went in company with a Miss\\nGrear, who introduced her to the family of Mr. James Latourette, a\\nwealthy merchant, and a Methodist in religion; but who, the latter part\\nof his life, felt that he had outgrown ordinances, and advocated free\\nmeetings, holding them at his own dwelling-house for several years\\nprevious to his death.  She worked for them, and they generously gave\\nher a home while she labored for others, and in their kindness made her\\nas one of their own.\\n\\n\\nAt that time, the \\'moral reform\\' movement was awakening the attention\\nof the benevolent in that city.  Many women, among whom were Mrs.\\nLatourette and Miss Grear, became deeply interested in making an\\nattempt to reform their fallen sisters, even the most degraded of them;\\nand in this enterprise of labor and danger, they enlisted Isabella and\\nothers, who for a time put forth their most zealous efforts, and\\nperformed the work of missionaries with much apparent success.\\nIsabella accompanied those ladies to the most wretched abodes of vice\\nand misery, and sometimes she went where they dared not follow.  They\\neven succeeded in establishing prayer-meetings in several places, where\\nsuch a thing might least have been expected.\\n\\n\\nBut these meetings soon became the most noisy, shouting, ranting, and\\nboisterous of gatherings; where they became delirious with excitement,\\nand then exhausted from over-action.  Such meetings Isabel had not much\\nsympathy with, at best.  But one evening she attended one of them,\\nwhere the members of it, in a fit of ecstasy, jumped upon her cloak in\\nsuch a manner as to drag her to the floor-and then, thinking she had\\nfallen in a spiritual trance, they increased their glorifications on\\nher account,-jumping, shouting, stamping, and clapping of hands;\\nrejoicing so much over her spirit, and so entirely overlooking her\\nbody, that she suffered much, both from fear and bruises; and ever\\nafter refused to attend any more such meetings, doubting much whether\\nGod had any thing to do with such worship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MATTHIAS DELUSION.\\n\\n\\nWe now come to an eventful period in the life of Isabella, as\\nidentified with one of the most extraordinary religious delusions of\\nmodern times; but the limits prescribed for the present work forbid a\\nminute narration of all the occurrences that transpired in relation to\\nit.\\n\\n\\nAfter she had joined the African Church in Church street, and during\\nher membership there, she frequently attended Mr. Latourette\\'s\\nmeetings, at one of which, Mr. Smith invited her to go to a\\nprayer-meeting, or to instruct the girls at the Magdalene Asylum,\\nBowery Hill, then under the protection of Mr. Pierson, and some other\\npersons, chiefly respectable females.  To reach the Asylum, Isabella\\ncalled on Katy, Mr. Pierson\\'s colored servant, of whom she had some\\nknowledge.  Mr. Pierson saw her there, conversed with her, asked her if\\nshe had been baptized, and was answered, characteristically, \\'by the\\nHoly Ghost.\\'  After this, Isabella saw Katy several times, and\\noccasionally Mr. Pierson, who engaged her to keep his house while Katy\\nwent to Virginia to see her children.  This engagement was considered\\nan answer to a prayer by Mr. Pierson, who had both fasted and prayed on\\nthe subject, while Katy and Isabella appeared to see in it the hand of\\nGod.\\n\\n\\nMr. Pierson was characterized by a strong devotional spirit, which\\nfinally became highly fanatical.  He assumed the title of Prophet,\\nasserting that God had called him in an omnibus, in these words:-\\'Thou\\nare Elijah, the Tishbite.  Gather unto me all the members of Israel at\\nthe foot of Mount Carmel\\'; which he understood as meaning the gathering\\nof his friends at Bowery Hill.  Not long afterward, he became\\nacquainted with the notorious Matthias, whose career was as\\nextraordinary as it was brief.  Robert Matthews, or Matthias (as he was\\nusually called), was of Scotch extraction, but a native of Washington\\nCounty, New York, and at that time about forty-seven years of age.  He\\nwas religiously brought up, among the Anti-Burghers, a sect of\\nPresbyterians; the clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Bevridge, visiting the\\nfamily after the manner of the church, and being pleased with Robert,\\nput his hand on his head, when a boy, and pronounced a blessing, and\\nthis blessing, with his natural qualities, determined his character;\\nfor he ever after thought he should be a distinguished man.  Matthias\\nwas brought up a farmer till nearly eighteen years of age, but\\nacquired indirectly the art of a carpenter, without any regular\\napprenticeship, and showed considerable mechanical skill.  He obtained\\nproperty from his uncle, Robert Thompson, and then he went into\\nbusiness as a store-keeper, was considered respectable, and became a\\nmember of the Scotch Presbyterian Church.  He married in 1813, and\\ncontinued in business in Cambridge.  In 1816, he ruined himself by a\\nbuilding speculation, and the derangement of the currency which denied\\nbank facilities, and soon after he came to New York with his family,\\nand worked at his trade.  He afterwards removed to Albany, and became a\\nhearer at the Dutch Reformed Church, then under Dr. Ludlow\\'s charge.\\nHe was frequently much excited on religious subjects.\\n\\n\\nIn 1829, he was well known, if not for street preaching, for loud\\ndiscussions and pavement exhortations, but he did not make set sermons.\\nIn the beginning of 1830, he was only considered zealous; but in the\\nsame year he prophesied the destruction of the Albanians and their\\ncapital, and while preparing to shave, with the Bible before him, he\\nsuddenly put down the soap and exclaimed, \\'I have found it!  I have\\nfound a text which proves that no man who shaves his beard can be a\\ntrue Christian;\\' and shortly afterwards, without shaving, he went to\\nthe Mission House to deliver an address which he had promised, and in\\nthis address, he proclaimed his new character, pronounced vengeance on\\nthe land, and that the law of God was the only rule of government, and\\nthat he was commanded to take possession of the world in the name of\\nthe King of kings.  His harangue was cut short by the trustees putting\\nout the lights.  About this time, Matthias laid by his implements of\\nindustry, and in June, he advised his wife to fly with him from the\\ndestruction which awaited them in the city; and on her refusal, partly\\non account of Matthias calling himself a Jew, whom she was unwilling to\\nretain as a husband, he left her, taking some of the children to his\\nsister in Argyle, forty miles from Albany.  At Argyle he entered the\\nchurch and interrupted the minister, declaring the congregation in\\ndarkness, and warning them to repentance.  He was, of course, taken out\\nof the church, and as he was advertised in the Albany papers, he was\\nsent back to his family.  His beard had now obtained a respectable\\nlength, and thus he attracted attention, and easily obtained an\\naudience in the streets.  For this he was sometimes arrested, once by\\nmistake for Adam Paine, who collected the crowd, and then left Matthias\\nwith it on the approach of the officers.  He repeatedly urged his wife\\nto accompany him on a mission to convert the world, declaring that food\\ncould be obtained from the roots of the forest, if not administered\\notherwise.  At this time he assumed the name of Matthias, called\\nhimself a Jew, and set out on a mission, taking a western course, and\\nvisiting a brother at Rochester, a skillful mechanic, since dead.\\nLeaving his brother, he proceeded on his mission over the Northern\\nStates, occasionally returning to Albany.\\n\\n\\nAfter visiting Washington, and passing through Pennsylvania, he came to\\nNew York.  His appearance at that time was mean, but grotesque, and his\\nsentiments were but little known.\\n\\n\\nOn May the 5th, 1832, he first called on Mr. Pierson, in Fourth street,\\nin his absence.  Isabella was alone in the house, in which she had\\nlived since the previous autumn.  On opening the door, she, for the\\nfirst time, beheld Matthias, and her early impression of seeing Jesus\\nin the flesh rushed to her mind.  She heard his inquiry, and invited\\nhim into the parlor; and being naturally curious, and much excited, and\\npossessing a good deal of tact, she drew him into conversation, stated\\nher own opinions, and heard his replies and explanations.  Her faith\\nwas at first staggered by his declaring himself a Jew; but on this\\npoint she was relieved by his saying, \\'Do you not remember how Jesus\\nprayed?\\' and repeated part of the Lord\\'s Prayer, in proof that the\\nFather\\'s kingdom was to come, and not the Son\\'s.  She then understood\\nhim to be a converted Jew, and in the conclusion she says she \\'felt as\\nif God had sent him to set up the kingdom.\\'  Thus Matthias at once\\nsecured the good will of Isabella, and we may supposed obtained from\\nher some information in relation to Mr. Pierson, especially that Mrs.\\nPierson declared there was no true church, and approved of Mr.\\nPierson\\'s preaching.  Matthias left the house, promising to return on\\nSaturday evening.  Mr. P. at this time had not seen Matthias.\\n\\n\\nIsabella, desirous of hearing the expected conversation between\\nMatthias and Mr. Pierson on Saturday, hurried her work, got it\\nfinished, and was permitted to be present.  Indeed, the sameness of\\nbelief made her familiar with her employer, while her attention to her\\nwork, and characteristic faithfulness, increased his confidence.  This\\nintimacy, the result of holding the same faith, and the principle\\nafterwards adopted of having but one table, and all things in common,\\nmade her at once the domestic and the equal, and the depositary of very\\ncurious, if not valuable information.  To this object, even her color\\nassisted.  Persons who have traveled in the South know the manner in\\nwhich the colored people, and especially slaves, are treated; they are\\nscarcely regarded as being present.  This trait in our American\\ncharacter has been frequently noticed by foreign travelers.  One\\nEnglish lady remarks that she discovered, in course of conversation\\nwith a Southern married gentleman, that a colored girl slept in his\\nbedroom, in which also was his wife; and when he saw that it occasioned\\nsome surprise, he remarked, \\'What would he do if he wanted a glass of\\nwater in the night?\\'  Other travelers have remarked that the presence\\nof colored people never seemed to interrupt a conversation of any kind\\nfor one moment.  Isabella, then, was present at the first interview\\nbetween Matthias and Pierson.  At this interview, Mr. Pierson asked\\nMatthias if he had a family, to which he replied in the affirmative; he\\nasked him about his beard, and he gave a scriptural reason, asserting\\nalso that the Jews did not shave, and that Adam had a beard.  Mr.\\nPierson detailed to Matthias his experience, and Matthias gave his, and\\nthey mutually discovered that they held the same sentiments, both\\nadmitting the direct influence of the Spirit, and the transmission of\\nspirits from one body to another.  Matthias admitted the call of Mr.\\nPierson, in the omnibus in Wall street, which, on this occasion, he\\ngave in these words:-\\'Thou art Elijah the Tishbite, and thou shalt go\\nbefore me in the spirit and power of Elias, to prepare my way before\\nme.\\'  And Mr. Pierson admitted Matthias\\' call, who completed his\\ndeclaration on the 20th of June, in Argyle, which, by a curious\\ncoincidence, was the very day on which Pierson had received his call in\\nthe omnibus.  Such singular coincidences have a powerful effect on\\nexcited minds.  From that discovery, Pierson and Matthias rejoiced in\\neach other, and became kindred spirits-Matthias, however, claiming to\\nbe the Father, or to possess the spirit of the Father-he was God upon\\nthe earth, because the spirit of God dwelt in him; while Pierson then\\nunderstood that his mission was like that of John the Baptist, which\\nthe name Elias meant.  This conference ended with an invitation to\\nsupper, and Matthias and Pierson washing each other\\'s feet.  Mr.\\nPierson preached on the following Sunday, but after which, he declined\\nin favor of Matthias, and some of the party believed that the \\'kingdom\\nhad then come.\\'\\n\\n\\nAs a specimen of Matthias\\' preaching and sentiments, the following is\\nsaid to be reliable:\\n\\n\\n\\'The spirit that built the Tower of Babel is now in the world-it is the\\nspirit of the devil.  The spirit of man never goes upon the clouds; all\\nwho think so are Babylonians.  The only heaven is on earth.  All who\\nare ignorant of truth are Ninevites.  The Jews did not crucify Christ-\\nit was the Gentiles.  Every Jew has his guardian angel attending him in\\nthis world.  God don\\'t speak through preachers; he speaks through me,\\nhis prophet.\\n\\n\\n\\' \" John the Baptist,\" (addressing Mr. Pierson),  \"read the tenth\\nchapter of Revelations.\" After the reading of the chapter, the prophet\\nresumed speaking, as follows:-\\n\\n\\n\\'Ours is the mustard-seed kingdom which is to spread all over the\\nearth.  Our creed is truth, and no man can find truth unless he obeys\\nJohn the Baptist, and comes clean into the church.\\n\\n\\n\\'All real men will be saved; all mock men will be damned.  When a\\nperson has the Holy Ghost, then he is a man, and not till then.  They\\nwho teach women are of the wicked.  The communion is all nonsense; so\\nis prayer.  Eating a nip of bread and drinking a little wine won\\'t do\\nany good.  All who admit members into their church, and suffer them to\\nhold their lands and houses, their sentence is, \"Depart, ye wicked, I\\nknow you not.\"  All females who lecture their husbands, their sentence\\nis the same.  The sons of truth are to enjoy all the good things of\\nthis world, and must use their means to bring it about.  Every thing\\nthat has the smell of woman will be destroyed.  Woman is the capsheaf\\nof the abomination of desolation-full of all deviltry.  In a short\\ntime, the world will take fire and dissolve; it is combustible\\nalready.  All women, not obedient, had better become so as soon as\\npossible, and let the wicked spirit depart, and become temples of\\ntruth.  Praying is all mocking.  When you see any one wring the neck of\\na fowl, instead of cutting off its head, he has not got the Holy Ghost.\\n(Cutting gives the least pain.)\\n\\n\\n\\'All who eat swine\\'s flesh are of the devil; and just as certain as he\\neats it, he will tell a lie in less than half an hour.  If you eat a\\npiece of pork, it will go crooked through you, and the Holy Ghost will\\nnot stay in you, but one or the other must leave the house pretty soon.\\nThe pork will be as crooked in you as ram\\'s horns, and as great a\\nnuisance as the hogs in the street.\\n\\n\\n\\'The cholera is not the right word; it is choler, which means God\\'s\\nwrath.  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are now in this world; they did not\\ngo up in the clouds, as some believe-why should they go there?  They\\ndon\\'t want to go there to box the compass from one place to another.\\nThe Christians now-a-days are for setting up the Son\\'s kingdom.  It is\\nnot his; it is the Father\\'s kingdom.  It puts me in mind of a man in\\nthe country, who took his son in business, and had his sign made,\\n\"Hitchcock & Son;\" but the son wanted it \"Hitchcock & Father\"-and that\\nis the way with your Christians.  They talk of the Son\\'s kingdom\\nfirst, and not the Father\\'s kingdom.\\'\\n\\n\\nMatthias and his disciples at this time did not believe in a\\nresurrection of the body, but that the spirits of the former saints\\nwould enter the bodies of the present generation, and thus begin heaven\\non earth, of which he and Mr. Pierson were the first fruits.\\n\\n\\nMatthias made the residence of Mr. Pierson his own; but the latter,\\nbeing apprehensive of popular violence in his house, if Matthias\\nremained there, proposed a monthly allowance to him, and advised him to\\noccupy another dwelling.  Matthias accordingly took a house in Clarkson\\nstreet, and then sent for his family at Albany, but they declined\\ncoming to the city.  However, his brother George complied with a\\nsimilar offer, bringing his family with him, where they found very\\ncomfortable quarters.  Isabella was employed to do the housework.  In\\nMay, 1833, Matthias left his house, and placed the furniture, part of\\nwhich was Isabella\\'s, elsewhere, living himself at the hotel corner of\\nMarketfield and West streets.   Isabella found employment at Mr.\\nWhiting\\'s, Canal street, and did the washing for Matthias by Mrs.\\nWhiting\\'s permission.\\n\\n\\nOf the subsequent removal of Matthias to the farm and residence of Mr.\\nB. Folger, at Sing Sing, where he was joined by Mr. Pierson, and others\\nlaboring under a similar religious delusion-the sudden, melancholy and\\nsomewhat suspicious death of Mr. Pierson, and the arrest of Matthias on\\nthe charge of his murder, ending in a verdict of not guilty-the\\ncriminal connection that subsisted between Matthias, Mrs. Folger, and\\nother members of the \\'Kingdom,\\' as \\'match-spirits\\'-the final dispersion\\nof this deluded company, and the voluntary exilement of Matthias in the\\nfar West, after his release-&c. &c., we do not deem it useful or\\nnecessary to give any particulars.  Those who are curious to know what\\nthere transpired are referred to a work published in New York in 1835,\\nentitled \\'Fanaticism; its Sources and Influence; illustrated by the\\nsimple Narrative of Isabella, in the case of Matthias, Mr. and Mrs. B.\\nFolger, Mr. Pierson, Mr. Mills, Catharine, Isabella, &c. &c. By G.\\nVale, 84 Roosevelt street.\\'  Suffice it to say, that while Isabella was\\na member of the household at Sing Sing, doing much laborious service in\\nthe spirit of religious disinterestedness, and gradually getting her\\nvision purged and her mind cured of its illusions, she happily escaped\\nthe contamination that surrounded her,-assiduously endeavoring to\\ndischarge all her duties in a becoming manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFASTING.\\n\\n\\nWhen Isabella resided with Mr. Pierson, he was in the habit of fasting\\nevery Friday; not eating or drinking anything from Thursday evening to\\nsix o\\'clock on Friday evening.\\n\\n\\nThen, again, he would fast two nights and three days, neither eating\\nnor drinking; refusing himself even a cup of cold water till the third\\nday at night, when he took supper again, as usual.\\n\\n\\nIsabella asked him why he fasted.  He answered, that fasting gave him\\ngreat light in the things of God; which answer gave birth to the\\nfollowing train of thought in the mind of his auditor:-\\'Well, if\\nfasting will give light inwardly and spiritually, I need it as much as\\nany body,-and I\\'ll fast too.  If Mr. Pierson needs to fast two nights\\nand three days, then I, who need light more than he does, ought to fast\\nmore, and I will fast three nights and three days.\\'\\n\\n\\nThis resolution she carried out to the letter, putting not so much as a\\ndrop of water in her mouth for three whole days and nights.  The fourth\\nmorning, as she arose to her feet, not having the power to stand, she\\nfell to the floor; but recovering herself sufficiently, she made her\\nway to the pantry, and feeling herself quite voracious, and fearing\\nthat she might now offend God by her voracity, compelled herself to\\nbreakfast on dry bread and water-eating a large six-penny loaf before\\nshe felt at all stayed or satisfied.  She says she did get light, but\\nit was all in her body and none in her mind-and this lightness of body\\nlasted a long time.  Oh! she was so light, and felt so well, she could\\n\\'skim around like a gull.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CAUSE OF HER LEAVING THE CITY.\\n\\n\\nThe first years spent by Isabella in the city, she accumulated more\\nthan enough to satisfy all her wants, and she placed all the overplus\\nin the Savings\\' Bank.  Afterwards, while living with Mr. Pierson, he\\nprevailed on her to take it all thence, and invest it in a common fund\\nwhich he was about establishing, as a fund to be drawn from by all the\\nfaithful; the faithful, of course, were the handful that should\\nsubscribe to his peculiar creed.  This fund, commenced by Mr. Pierson,\\nafterwards became part and parcel of the kingdom of which Matthias\\nassumed to be head; and at the breaking up of the kingdom, her little\\nproperty was merged in the general ruin-or went to enrich those who\\nprofited by the loss of others, if any such there were.  Mr. Pierson\\nand others had so assured her, that the fund would supply all her\\nwants, at all times, and in all emergencies, and to the end of life,\\nthat she became perfectly careless on the subject-asking for no\\ninterest when she drew her money from the bank, and taking no account\\nof the sum she placed in the fund.  She recovered a few articles of the\\nfurniture from the wreck of the kingdom, and received a small sum of\\nmoney from Mr. B. Folger, as the price of Mrs. Folger\\'s attempt to\\nconvict her of murder.  With this to start upon, she commenced anew her\\nlabors, in the hope of yet being able to accumulate a sufficiency to\\nmake a little home for herself, in her advancing age.  With this\\nstimulus before her, she toiled hard, working early and late, doing a\\ngreat deal for a little money, and turning her hand to almost anything\\nthat promised good pay.  Still, she did not prosper, and somehow, could\\nnot contrive to lay by a single dollar for a \\'rainy day.\\'\\n\\n\\nWhen this had been the state of her affairs some time, she suddenly\\npaused, and taking a retrospective view of what had passed, inquired\\nwithin herself, why it was that, for all her unwearied labors, she had\\nnothing to show; why it was that others, with much less care and labor,\\ncould hoard up treasures for themselves and children?  She became more\\nand more convinced, as she reasoned, that every thing she had\\nundertaken in the city of New York had finally proved a failure; and\\nwhere her hopes had been raised the highest, there she felt the failure\\nhad been the greatest, and the disappointment most severe.\\n\\n\\nAfter turning it in her mind for some time, she came to the conclusion,\\nthat she had been taking part in a great drama, which was, in itself,\\nbut one great system of robbery and wrong.  \\'Yes,\\' she said, \\'the rich\\nrob the poor, and the poor rob one another.\\'  True, she had not\\nreceived labor from others, and stinted their pay, as she felt had been\\npractised against her; but she had taken their work from them, which\\nwas their only means to get money, and was the same to them in the end.\\nFor instance-a gentleman where she lived would give her a dollar to\\nhire a poor man to clear the new-fallen snow from the steps and\\nside-walks.  She would arise early, and perform the labor herself,\\nputting the money into her own pocket.  A poor man would come along,\\nsaying she ought to have let him have the job; he was poor, and needed\\nthe pay for his family.  She would harden her heart against him, and\\nanswer-\\'I am poor too, and I need it for mine.\\'  But, in her\\nretrospection, she thought of all the misery she might have been adding\\nto, in her selfish grasping, and it troubled her conscience sorely; and\\nthis insensibility to the claims of human brotherhood, and the wants of\\nthe destitute and wretched poor, she now saw, as she never had done\\nbefore, to be unfeeling, selfish and wicked.  These reflections and\\nconvictions gave rise to a sudden revulsion of feeling in the heart of\\nIsabella, and she began to look upon money and property with great\\nindifference, if not contempt-being at that time unable, probably, to\\ndiscern any difference between a miserly grasping at and hoarding of\\nmoney and means, and a true use of the good things of this life for\\none\\'s own comfort, and the relief of such as she might be enabled to\\nbefriend and assist.  One thing she was sure of-that the precepts, \\'Do\\nunto others as ye would that others should do unto you,\\' \\'Love your\\nneighbor as yourself,\\' and so forth, were maxims that had been but\\nlittle thought of by herself, or practised by those about her.\\n\\n\\nHer next decision was, that she must leave the city; it was no place\\nfor her; yea, she felt called in spirit to leave it, and to travel east\\nand lecture.  She had never been further east than the city, neither\\nhad she any friends there of whom she had particular reason to expect\\nany thing; yet to her it was plain that her mission lay in the east,\\nand that she would find friends there.  She determined on leaving; but\\nthese determinations and convictions she kept close locked in her own\\nbreast, knowing that if her children and friends were aware of it, they\\nwould make such an ado about it as would render it very unpleasant, if\\nnot distressing to all parties.  Having made what preparations for\\nleaving she deemed necessary,-which was, to put up a few articles of\\nclothing in a pillow-case, all else being deemed an unnecessary\\nincumbrance,-about an hour before she left, she informed Mrs. Whiting,\\nthe woman of the house where she was stopping, that her name was no\\nlonger Isabella, but SOJOURNER; and that she was going east.  And to\\nher inquiry, \\'What are you going east for?\\' her answer was, \\'The Spirit\\ncalls me there, and I must go.\\'\\n\\n\\nShe left the city on the morning of the 1st of June, 1843, crossing\\nover to Brooklyn, L.I.; and taking the rising sun for her only compass\\nand guide, she \\'remembered Lot\\'s wife,\\' and hoping to avoid her fate,\\nshe resolved not to look back till she felt sure the wicked city from\\nwhich she was fleeing was left too far behind to be visible in the\\ndistance; and when she first ventured to look back, she could just\\ndiscern the blue cloud of smoke that hung over it, and she thanked the\\nLord that she was thus far removed from what seemed to her a second\\nSodom.\\n\\n\\nShe was now fairly started on her pilgrimage; her bundle in one hand,\\nand a little basket of provisions in the other, and two York shillings\\nin her purse-her heart strong in the faith that her true work lay\\nbefore her, and that the Lord was her director; and she doubted not he\\nwould provide for and protect her, and that it would be very censurable\\nin her to burden herself with any thing more than a moderate supply for\\nher then present needs.  Her mission was not merely to travel east, but\\nto \\'lecture,\\' as she designated it; \\'testifying of the hope that was in\\nher\\'-exhorting the people to embrace Jesus, and refrain from sin, the\\nnature and origin of which she explained to them in accordance with her\\nown most curious and original views.  Through her life, and all its\\nchequered changes, she has ever clung fast to her first permanent\\nimpressions on religious subjects.\\n\\n\\nWherever night overtook her, there she sought for lodgings-free, if she\\nmight-if not, she paid; at a tavern, if she chanced to be at one-if\\nnot, at a private dwelling; with the rich, if they would receive her-if\\nnot, with the poor.\\n\\n\\nBut she soon discovered that the largest houses were nearly always\\nfull; if not quite full, company was soon expected; and that it was\\nmuch easier to find an unoccupied corner in a small house than in a\\nlarge one; and if a person possessed but a miserable roof over his\\nhead, you might be sure of a welcome to part of it.\\n\\n\\nBut this, she had penetration enough to see, was quite as much the\\neffect of a want of sympathy as of benevolence; and this was also very\\napparent in her religious conversations with people who were strangers\\nto her.  She said, \\'she never could find out that the rich had any\\nreligion.  If I had been rich and accomplished, I could; for the rich\\ncould always find religion in the rich, and I could find it among the\\npoor.\\'\\n\\n\\nAt first, she attended such meetings as she heard of, in the vicinity\\nof her travels, and spoke to the people as she found them assembled.\\nAfterwards, she advertised meetings of her own, and held forth to large\\naudiences, having, as she said, \\'a good time.\\'\\n\\n\\nWhen she became weary of travelling, and wished a place to stop a while\\nand rest herself, she said some opening for her was always near at\\nhand; and the first time she needed rest, a man accosted her as she was\\nwalking, inquiring if she was looking for work.  She told him that was\\nnot the object of her travels, but that she would willingly work a few\\ndays, if any one wanted.  He requested her to go to his family, who\\nwere sadly in want of assistance, which he had been thus far unable to\\nsupply.  She went to the house where she was directed, and was received\\nby his family, one of whom was ill, as a \\'Godsend;\\' and when she felt\\nconstrained to resume her journey, they were very sorry, and would fain\\nhave detained her longer; but as she urged the necessity of leaving,\\nthey offered her what seemed in her eyes a great deal of money as a\\nremuneration for her labor, and an expression of their gratitude for\\nher opportune assistance; but she would only receive a very little of\\nit; enough, as she says, to enable her to pay tribute to Caesar, if it\\nwas demanded of her; and two or three York shillings at a time were all\\nshe allowed herself to take; and then, with purse replenished, and\\nstrength renewed, she would once more set out to perform her mission.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF REFUSING A TRAVELLER A NIGHT\\'S LODGING.\\n\\n\\nAs she drew near the center of the Island, she commenced, one evening\\nat nightfall, to solicit the favor of a night\\'s lodging.  She had\\nrepeated her request a great many, it seemed to her some twenty times,\\nand as many times she received a negative answer.  She walked on, the\\nstars and the tiny horns of the new moon shed but a dim light on her\\nlonely way, when she was familiarly accosted by two Indians, who took\\nher for an acquaintance.  She told them they were mistaken in the\\nperson; she was a stranger there, and asked them the direction to a\\ntavern.  They informed her it was yet a long way-some two miles or so;\\nand inquired if she were alone.  Not wishing for their protection, or\\nknowing what might be the character of their kindness, she answered,\\n\\'No, not exactly,\\' and passed on.  At the end of a weary way, she came\\nto the tavern,-or rather, to a large building, which was occupied as a\\ncourt-house, tavern, and jail,-and on asking for a night\\'s lodging, was\\ninformed she could stay, if she would consent to be locked in.  This to\\nher mind was an insuperable objection.  To have a key turned on her was\\na thing not to be thought of, at least not to be endured, and she again\\ntook up her line of march, preferring to walk beneath the open sky, to\\nbeing locked up by a stranger in such a place.  She had not walked far,\\nbefore she heard the voice of a woman under an open shed;\\n\\nshe ventured to accost her, and inquired if she knew where she\\ncould get in for the night. The woman answered, that she did\\nnot, unless she went home with them; and turning to her \\'good\\nman,\\' asked him if the stranger could not share their home for\\nthe night, to which he cheerfully assented. Sojourner thought it\\nevident he had been taking a drop too much, but as he was civil\\nand good-natured, and she did not feel inclined to spend the\\nnight alone in the open air, she felt driven to the necessity of\\naccepting their hospitality, whatever it might prove to be. The\\nwoman soon informed her that there was a ball in the place, at\\nwhich they would like to drop in a while, before they went to\\ntheir home.\\n\\nBalls being no part of Sojourner\\'s mission, she was not desirous\\nof attending; but her hostess could be satisfied with nothing\\nshort of a taste of it, and she was forced to go with her, or\\nrelinquish their company at once, in which move there might be\\nmore exposure than in accompanying her. She went, and soon\\nfound herself surrounded by an assemblage of people, collected\\nfrom the very dregs of society, too ignorant and degraded to\\nunderstand, much less entertain, a high or bright idea,-in a\\ndirty hovel, destitute of every comfort, and where the fumes of\\nwhiskey were abundant and powerful.\\n\\nSojourner\\'s guide there was too much charmed with the\\ncombined entertainments of the place to be able to tear herself\\naway, till she found her faculties for enjoyment failing her, from\\na too free use of liquor; and she betook herself to bed till she\\ncould recover them. Sojourner, seated in a corner, had time for\\nmany reflections, and refrained from lecturing them, in obedience\\nto the recommendation, \\'Cast not your pearls,\\' &c. When\\nthe night was far spent, the husband of the sleeping woman\\naroused the sleeper, and reminded her that she was not very\\npolite to the woman she had invited to sleep at her house, and\\nof the propriety of returning home. They once more emerged\\ninto the pure air, which to our friend Sojourner, after so long\\nbreathing the noisome air of the ball-room, was most refreshing\\nand grateful. Just as day dawned, they reached the place they\\ncalled their home. Sojourner now saw that she had lost nothing\\nin the shape of rest by remaining so long at the ball, as their\\nmiserable cabin afforded but one bunk or pallet for sleeping; and\\nhad there been many such, she would have preferred sitting up\\nall night to occupying one like it. They very politely offered her\\nthe bed, if she would use it; but civilly declining, she waited for\\nmorning with an eagerness of desire she never felt before on the\\nsubject, and was never more happy than when the eye of day\\nshed its golden light once more over the earth. She was once\\nmore free, and while daylight should last, independent, and\\nneeded no invitation to pursue her journey. Let these facts teach\\nus, that every pedestrian in the world is not a vagabond, and that\\nit is a dangerous thing to compel any one to receive that hospitality\\nfrom the vicious and abandoned which they should have\\nreceived from us,-as thousands can testify, who have thus been\\ncaught in the snares of the wicked.\\n\\nThe fourth of July, Isabella arrived at Huntingdon; from\\nthence she went to Cold Springs, where she found the people\\nmaking preparations for a mass temperance-meeting. With her\\nusual alacrity, she entered into their labors, getting up dishes a la\\nNew York, greatly to the satisfaction of those she assisted. After\\nremaining at Cold Springs some three weeks, she returned to\\nHuntingdon, where she took boat for Connecticut. Landing at\\nBridgeport, she again resumed her travels towards the north-east,\\nlecturing some, and working some, to get wherewith to pay\\ntribute to Caesar, as she called it; and in this manner she presently\\ncame to the city of New Haven, where she found many meetings,\\nwhich she attended-at some of which, she was allowed to\\nexpress her views freely, and without reservation. She also called\\nmeetings expressly to give herself an opportunity to be heard;\\nand found in the city many true friends of Jesus, as she judged,\\nwith whom she held communion of spirit, having no preference\\nfor one sect more than another, but being well satisfied with all\\nwho gave her evidence of having known or loved the Saviour.\\n\\nAfter thus delivering her testimony in this pleasant city, feeling\\nshe had not as yet found an abiding place, she went from\\nthence to Bristol, at the request of a zealous sister, who desired\\nher to go to the latter place, and hold a religious conversation\\nwith some friends of hers there. She went as requested, found\\nthe people kindly and religiously disposed, and through them\\nshe became acquainted with several very interesting persons.\\n\\nA spiritually-minded brother in Bristol, becoming interested\\nin her new views and original opinions, requested as a favor that\\nshe would go to Hartford, to see and converse with friends of his\\nthere. Standing ready to perform any service in the Lord, she\\nwent to Hartford as desired, bearing in her hand the following\\nnote from this brother:-\\n\\n\\'SISTER,-I send you this living messenger, as I believe\\nher to be one that God loves. Ethiopia is stretching forth\\nher hands unto God. You can see by this sister, that God\\ndoes by his Spirit alone teach his own children things to\\ncome. Please receive her, and she will tell you some new\\nthings. Let her tell her story without interrupting her, and\\ngive close attention, and you will see she has got the lever\\nof truth, that God helps her to pry where but few can. She\\ncannot read or write, but the law is in her heart.\\n\\n\\'Send her to brother -, brother -, and where she can do\\nthe most good.\\n\\'From your brother, H. L. B.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSOME OF HER VIEWS AND REASONINGS.\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Isabella saw God as an all-powerful, all-pervading\\nspirit, she became desirous of hearing all that had been written\\nof him, and listened to the account of the creation of the world\\nand its first inhabitants, as contained in the first chapters of\\nGenesis, with peculiar interest. For some time she received it all\\nliterally, though it appeared strange to her that \\'God worked by\\nthe day, got tired, and stopped to rest,\\' &c. But after a little time,\\nshe began to reason upon it, thus-\\'Why, if God works by the\\nday, and one day\\'s work tires him, and he is obliged to rest,\\neither from weariness or on account of darkness, or if he waited\\nfor the \"cool of the day to walk in the garden,\" because he was\\ninconvenienced by the heat of the sun, why then it seems that\\nGod cannot do as much as I can; for I can bear the sun at noon,\\nand work several days and nights in succession without being\\nmuch tired. Or, if he rested nights because of the darkness, it is\\nvery queer that he should make the night so dark that he could\\nnot see himself. If I had been God, I would have made the night\\nlight enough for my own convenience, surely.\\' But the moment\\nshe placed this idea of God by the side of the impression\\nshe had once so suddenly received of his inconceivable greatness\\nand entire spirituality, that moment she exclaimed mentally,\\n\\'No, God does not stop to rest, for he is a spirit, and cannot tire;\\nhe cannot want for light, for he hath all light in himself. And if\\n\"God is all in all,\" and \"worketh all in all,\" as I have heard them\\nread, then it is impossible he should rest at all; for if he did, every\\nother thing would stop and rest too; the waters would not flow,\\nand the fishes could not swim; and all motion must cease. God\\ncould have no pauses in his work, and he needed no Sabbaths of\\nrest. Man might need them, and he should take them when he\\nneeded them, whenever he required rest. As it regarded the\\nworship of God, he was to be worshipped at all times and in all\\nplaces; and one portion of time never seemed to her more holy\\nthan another.\\'\\n\\nThese views, which were the results of the workings of her\\nown mind, assisted solely by the light of her own experience and\\nvery limited knowledge, were, for a long time after their adoption,\\nclosely locked in her own breast, fearing lest their avowal\\nmight bring upon her the imputation of \\'infidelity,\\'-the usual\\ncharge preferred by all religionists, against those who entertain\\nreligious views and feelings differing materially from their own.\\nIf, from their own sad experience, they are withheld from shouting\\nthe cry of \\'infidel,\\' they fail not to see and to feel, ay, and\\nto say, that the dissenters are not of the right spirit, and that their\\nspiritual eyes have never been unsealed.\\n\\nWhile travelling in Connecticut, she met a minister, with\\nwhom she held a long discussion on these points, as well as on\\nvarious other topics, such as the origin of all things, especially the\\norigin of evil, at the same time bearing her testimony strongly\\nagainst a paid ministry. He belonged to that class, and, as a matter\\nof course, as strongly advocated his own side of the question.\\n\\nI had forgotten to mention, in its proper place, a very important\\nfact, that when she was examining the Scriptures, she wished\\nto hear them without comment; but if she employed adult\\npersons to read them to her, and she asked them to read a passage\\nover again, they invariably commenced to explain, by giving her\\ntheir version of it; and in this way, they tried her feelings\\nexceedingly.\\nIn consequence of this, she ceased to ask adult persons to\\nread the Bible to her, and substituted children in their stead.\\nChildren, as soon as they could read distinctly, would re-read the\\nsame sentence to her, as often as she wished, and without\\ncomment; and in that way she was enabled to see what her own\\nmind could make out of the record, and that, she said, was what\\nshe wanted, and not what others thought it to mean. She wished\\nto compare the teachings of the Bible with the witness within\\nher; and she came to the conclusion, that the spirit of truth spoke\\nin those records, but that the recorders of those truths had\\nintermingled with them ideas and suppositions of their own.\\nThis is one among the many proofs of her energy and independence\\nof character.\\n\\nWhen it became known to her children, that Sojourner had\\nleft New York, they were filled with wonder and alarm. Where\\ncould she have gone, and why had she left? were questions no\\none could answer satisfactorily. Now, their imaginations painted\\nher as a wandering maniac-and again they feared she had been\\nleft to commit suicide; and many were the tears they shed at the\\nloss of her.\\n\\nBut when she reached Berlin, Conn., she wrote to them by\\namanuensis, informing them of her whereabouts, and waiting an\\nanswer to her letter; thus quieting their fears, and gladdening\\ntheir hearts once more with assurances of her continued life and\\nher love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SECOND ADVENT DOCTRINES.\\n\\n\\nIn Hartford and vicinity, she met with several persons who\\nbelieved in the \\'Second Advent\\' doctrines; or, the immediate\\npersonal appearance of Jesus Christ. At first she thought she had\\nnever heard of \\'Second Advent.\\' But when it was explained to\\nher, she recollected having once attended Mr. Miller\\'s meeting\\nin New York, where she saw a great many enigmatical pictures\\nhanging on the wall, which she could not understand, and\\nwhich, being out of the reach of her understanding, failed to\\ninterest her. In this section of country, she attended two\\ncamp-meetings of the believers in these doctrines-the \\'second advent\\'\\nexcitement being then at its greatest height. The last\\nmeeting was at Windsor Lock. The people, as a matter of course,\\neagerly inquired of her concerning her belief, as it regarded their\\nmost important tenet. She told them it had not been revealed to\\nher; perhaps, if she could read, she might see it differently.\\nSometimes, to their eager inquiry, \\'Oh, don\\'t you believe the\\nLord is coming?\\' she answered, \\'I believe the Lord is as near as\\nhe can be, and not be it.\\' With these evasive and non-exciting\\nanswers, she kept their minds calm as it respected her unbelief,\\ntill she could have an opportunity to hear their views fairly\\nstated, in order to judge more understandingly of this matter,\\nand see if, in her estimation, there was any good ground for\\nexpecting an event which was, in the minds of so many, as it\\nwere, shaking the very foundations of the universe. She was\\ninvited to join them in their religious exercises, and accepted the\\ninvitation-praying, and talking in her own peculiar style, and\\nattracting many about her by her singing.\\n\\nWhen she had convinced the people that she was a lover of\\nGod and his cause, and had gained a good standing with them,\\nso that she could get a hearing among them, she had become\\nquite sure in her own mind that they were laboring under a\\ndelusion, and she commenced to use her influence to calm the\\nfears of the people, and pour oil upon the troubled waters. In\\none part of the grounds, she found a knot of people greatly\\nexcited: she mounted a stump and called out, \\'Hear! hear!\\'\\nWhen the people had gathered around her, as they were in a\\nstate to listen to any thing new, she addressed them as \\'children,\\'\\nand asked them why they made such a \\'To-do;-are you\\nnot commanded to \"watch and pray?\" You are neither watching\\nnor praying.\\' And she bade them, with the tones of a kind\\nmother, retire to their tents, and there watch and pray, without\\nnoise or tumult, for the Lord would not come to such a scene\\nof confusion; \\'the Lord came still and quiet.\\' She assured them,\\n\\'the Lord might come, move all through the camp, and go away\\nagain, and they never know it,\\' in the state they then were.\\n\\nThey seemed glad to seize upon any reason for being less\\nagitated and distressed, and many of them suppressed their noisy\\nterror, and retired to their tents to \\'watch and pray;\\' begging\\nothers to do the same, and listen to the advice of the good sister.\\nShe felt she had done some good, and then went to listen further\\nto the preachers. They appeared to her to be doing their utmost\\nto agitate and excite the people, who were already too much\\nexcited; and when she had listened till her feelings would let her\\nlisten silently no longer, she arose and addressed the preachers.\\nThe following are specimens of her speech:-\\n\\n\\'Here you are talking about being \"changed in the twinkling\\nof an eye.\" If the Lord should come, he\\'d change you to nothing!\\nfor there is nothing to you.\\n\\n\\'You seem to be expecting to go to some parlor away up\\nsomewhere, and when the wicked have been burnt, you are\\ncoming back to walk in triumph over their ashes-this is to\\nbe your New Jerusalem!! Now, I can\\'t see any thing so very\\nnice in that, coming back to such a muss as that will be, a\\nworld covered with the ashes of the wicked! Besides, if the Lord\\ncomes and burns-as you say he will-I am not going away; I\\nam going to stay here and stand the fire, like Shadrach, Meshach,\\nand Abednego! And Jesus will walk with me through the fire,\\nand keep me from harm. Nothing belonging to God can burn,\\nany more than God himself; such shall have no need to go away\\nto escape the fire! No, I shall remain. Do you tell me that God\\'s\\nchildren can\\'t stand fire?\\' And her manner and tone spoke louder\\nthan words, saying, \\'It is absurd to think so!\\'\\n\\nThe ministers were taken quite aback at so unexpected an\\nopposer, and one of them, in the kindest possible manner,\\ncommenced a discussion with her, by asking her questions, and\\nquoting scripture to her; concluding, finally, that although she\\nhad learned nothing of the great doctrine which was so exclusively\\noccupying their minds at the time, she had learned much\\nthat man had never taught her.\\n\\nAt this meeting, she received the address of different persons,\\nresiding in various places, with an invitation to visit them. She\\npromised to go soon to Cabotville, and started, shaping her\\ncourse for that place. She arrived at Springfield one evening at\\nsix o\\'clock, and immediately began to search for a lodging for\\nthe night. She walked from six till past nine, and was then on the\\nroad from Springfield to Cabotville, before she found any one\\nsufficiently hospitable to give her a night\\'s shelter under their\\nroof. Then a man gave her twenty-five cents, and bade her\\ngo to a tavern and stay all night. She did so, returning in the\\nmorning to thank him, assuring him she had put his money to\\nits legitimate use. She found a number of the friends she had seen\\nat Windsor when she reached the manufacturing town of Cabotville,\\n(which has lately taken the name of Chicopee,) and\\nwith them she spent a pleasant week or more; after which, she\\nleft them to visit the Shaker village in Enfield. She now began\\nto think of finding a resting place, at least, for a season; for she\\nhad performed quite a long journey, considering she had walked\\nmost of the way; and she had a mind to look in upon the\\nShakers, and see how things were there, and whether there was\\nany opening there for her. But on her way back to Springfield,\\nshe called at a house and asked for a piece of bread; her request\\nwas granted, and she was kindly invited to tarry all night, as it\\nwas getting late, and she would not be able to stay at every house\\nin that vicinity, which invitation she cheerfully accepted. When\\nthe man of the house came in, he recollected having seen her at\\nthe camp-meeting, and repeated some conversations, by which\\nshe recognized him again. He soon proposed having a meeting\\nthat evening, went out and notified his friends and neighbors,\\nwho came together, and she once more held forth to them in her\\npeculiar style. Through the agency of this meeting, she became\\nacquainted with several people residing in Springfield, to whose\\nhouses she was cordially invited, and with whom she spent some\\npleasant time.\\n\\nOne of these friends, writing of her arrival there, speaks as\\nfollows. After saying that she and her people belonged to that\\nclass of persons who believed in the second advent doctrines; and\\nthat this class, believing also in freedom of speech and action,\\noften found at their meetings many singular people, who did not\\nagree with them in their principal doctrine; and that, being thus\\nprepared to hear new and strange things, \\'They listened eagerly\\nto Sojourner, and drank in all she said;\\'-and also, that she\\n\\'soon became a favorite among them; that when she arose to\\nspeak in their assemblies, her commanding figure and dignified\\nmanner hushed every trifler into silence, and her singular and\\nsometimes uncouth modes of expression never provoked a\\nlaugh, but often were the whole audience melted into tears by\\nher touching stories.\\' She also adds, \\'Many were the lessons of\\nwisdom and faith I have delighted to learn from her.\\' . . . . \\'She\\ncontinued a great favorite in our meetings, both on account of\\nher remarkable gift in prayer, and still more remarkable talent for\\nsinging, . . . and the aptness and point of her remarks, frequently\\nillustrated by figures the most original and expressive.\\n\\n\\'As we were walking the other day, she said she had often\\nthought what a beautiful world this would be, when we should\\nsee every thing right side up. Now, we see every thing topsy-turvy, and\\nall is confusion.\\' For a person who knows nothing of\\nthis fact in the science of optics, this seemed quite a remarkable\\nidea.\\n\\n\\'We also loved her for her sincere and ardent piety, her\\nunwavering faith in God, and her contempt of what the world\\ncalls fashion, and what we call folly.\\n\\n\\'She was in search of a quiet place, where a way-worn\\ntraveller might rest. She had heard of Fruitlands, and was\\ninclined to go there; but the friends she found here thought it\\nbest for her to visit Northampton. She passed her time, while\\nwith us, working wherever her work was needed, and talking\\nwhere work was not needed.\\n\\n\\'She would not receive money for her work, saying she\\nworked for the Lord; and if her wants were supplied, she\\nreceived it as from the Lord.\\n\\n\\'She remained with us till far into winter, when we introduced\\nher at the Northampton Association.\\' . . . . \\'She wrote to\\nme from thence, that she had found the quiet resting place she\\nhad so long desired. And she has remained there ever since.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nANOTHER CAMP MEETING.\\n\\n\\nWhen Sojourner had been at Northampton a few months, she\\nattended another camp-meeting, at which she performed a very\\nimportant part.\\n\\nA party of wild young men, with no motive but that of\\nentertaining themselves by annoying and injuring the feelings of\\nothers, had assembled at the meeting, hooting and yelling, and\\nin various ways interrupting the services, and causing much\\ndisturbance. Those who had the charge of the meeting, having\\ntried their persuasive powers in vain, grew impatient and tried\\nthreatening.\\n\\nThe young men, considering themselves insulted, collected\\ntheir friends, to the number of a hundred or more, dispersed\\nthemselves through the grounds, making the most frightful\\nnoises, and threatening to fire the tents. It was said the authorities\\nof the meeting sat in grave consultation, decided to have the\\nring-leaders arrested, and sent for the constable, to the great\\ndispleasure of some of the company, who were opposed to such\\nan appeal to force and arms. Be that as it may, Sojourner, seeing\\ngreat consternation depicted in every countenance, caught the\\ncontagion, and, ere she was aware, found herself quaking with\\nfear.\\n\\nUnder the impulse of this sudden emotion, she fled to the\\nmost retired corner of a tent, and secreted herself behind a trunk.\\nsaying to herself, \\'I am the only colored person here, and on me,\\nprobably, their wicked mischief will fall first, and perhaps fatally.\\'\\nBut feeling how great was her insecurity even there, as the\\nvery tent began to shake from its foundations, she began to\\nsoliloquise as follows:-\\n\\n\\'Shall I run away and hide from the Devil? Me, a servant of\\nthe living God? Have I not faith enough to go out and quell that\\nmob, when I know it is written-\"One shall chase a thousand,\\nand two put ten thousand to flight\"? I know there are not a\\nthousand here; and I know I am a servant of the living God. I\\'ll\\ngo to the rescue, and the Lord shall go with and protect me.\\n\\n\\'Oh,\\' said she, \\'I felt as if I had three hearts! and that they\\nwere so large, my body could hardly hold them!\\'\\n\\nShe now came forth from her hiding-place, and invited several\\nto go with her and see what they could do to still the raging\\nof the moral elements. They declined, and considered her wild\\nto think of it.\\n\\nThe meeting was in the open fields-the full moon shed its\\nsaddened light over all-and the woman who was that evening\\nto address them was trembling on the preachers\\' stand. The\\nnoise and confusion were now terrific. Sojourner left the tent\\nalone and unaided, and walking some thirty rods to the top of\\na small rise of ground, commenced to sing, in her most fervid\\nmanner, with all the strength of her most powerful voice, the\\nhymn on the resurrection of Christ-\\n\\nIt was early in the morning-it was early in the morning,\\n  Just at the break of day-\\nWhen he rose-when he rose-when he rose,\\n  And went to heaven on a cloud.\\'\\n\\n\\nAll who have ever heard her sing this hymn will probably\\nremember it as long as they remember her. The hymn, the tune,\\nthe style, are each too closely associated with to be easily\\nseparated from herself, and when sung in one of her most animated\\nmoods, in the open air, with the utmost strength of her most\\npowerful voice, must have been truly thrilling.\\n\\nAs she commenced to sing, the young men made a rush\\ntowards her, and she was immediately encircled by a dense body\\nof the rioters, many of them armed with sticks or clubs as their\\nweapons of defence, if not of attack. As the circle narrowed\\naround her, she ceased singing, and after a short pause, inquired,\\nin a gentle but firm tone, \\'Why do you come about me with\\nclubs and sticks? I am not doing harm to any one.\\' \\'We ar\\'n\\'t\\na going to hurt you, old woman; we came to hear you sing,\\'\\ncried many voices, simultaneously. \\'Sing to us, old woman,\\'\\ncries one. \\'Talk to us, old woman,\\' says another. \\'Pray, old\\nwoman,\\' says a third. \\'Tell us your experience,\\' says a fourth.\\n\\'You stand and smoke so near me, I cannot sing or talk,\\' she\\nanswered.\\n\\n\\'Stand back,\\' said several authoritative voices, with not the\\nmost gentle or courteous accompaniments, raising their rude\\nweapons in the air. The crowd suddenly gave back, the circle\\nbecame larger, as many voices again called for singing, talking,\\nor praying, backed by assurances that no one should be allowed\\nto hurt her-the speakers declaring with an oath, that they\\nwould \\'knock down \\' any person who should offer her the\\nleast indignity.\\n\\nShe looked about her, and with her usual discrimination, said\\ninwardly-\\'Here must be many young men in all this assemblage,\\nbearing within them hearts susceptible of good impressions.\\nI will speak to them.\\' She did speak; they silently heard,\\nand civilly asked her many questions. It seemed to her to be\\ngiven her at the time to answer them with truth and wisdom\\nbeyond herself. Her speech had operated on the roused passions\\nof the mob like oil on agitated waters; they were, as a whole,\\nentirely subdued, and only clamored when she ceased to speak\\nor sing. Those who stood in the back ground, after the circle was\\nenlarged, cried out, \\'Sing aloud, old woman, we can\\'t hear.\\'\\nThose who held the sceptre of power among them requested\\nthat she should make a pulpit of a neighboring wagon. She said,\\n\\'If I do, they\\'ll overthrow it.\\' \\'No, they sha\\'n\\'t-he who dares\\nhurt you, we\\'ll knock him down instantly, d-n him,\\' cried\\nthe chiefs. \\'No we won\\'t, no we won\\'t, nobody shall hurt you,\\'\\nanswered the many voices of the mob. They kindly assisted her\\nto mount the wagon, from which she spoke and sung to them\\nabout an hour. Of all she said to them on the occasion, she\\nremembers only the following:-\\n\\n\\'Well, there are two congregations on this ground. It is\\nwritten that there shall be a separation, and the sheep shall be\\nseparated from the goats. The other preachers have the sheep,\\nI have the goats. And I have a few sheep among my goats, but\\nthey are very ragged.\\' This exordium produced great laughter.\\nWhen she became wearied with talking, she began to cast about\\nher to contrive some way to induce them to disperse. While she\\npaused, they loudly clamored for \\'more,\\' \\'more,\\'-\\'sing,\\'\\n\\'sing more.\\' She motioned them to be quiet, and called out to\\nthem: \\'Children, I have talked and sung to you, as you asked\\nme; and now I have a request to make of you; will you grant it?\\'\\n\\'Yes, yes, yes,\\' resounded from every quarter. \\'Well, it is this,\\'\\nshe answered; \\'if I will sing one more hymn for you, will you\\nthen go away, and leave us this night in peace?\\' \\'Yes, yes,\\'\\ncame faintly, feebly from a few. \\'I repeat it,\\' says Sojourner,\\n\\'and I want an answer from you all, as of one accord. If I will\\nsing you one more, will you go away, and leave us this night in\\npeace?\\' \\'Yes, yes, yes,\\' shouted many voices, with hearty emphasis.\\n\\'I repeat my request once more,\\' said she, \\'and I want\\nyou all to answer.\\' And she reiterated the words again. This time\\na long, loud \\'Yes-yes-yes,\\' came up, as from the multitudinous mouth\\nof the entire mob. \\'AMEN! it is SEALED,\\' repeated\\nSojourner, in the deepest and most solemn tones of her powerful\\nand sonorous voice. Its effect ran through the multitude, like an\\nelectric shock; and the most of them considered themselves\\nbound by their promise, as they might have failed to do under\\nless imposing circumstances. Some of them began instantly to\\nleave; others said, \\'Are we not to have one more hymn?\\'\\n\\'Yes,\\' answered their entertainer, and she commenced to sing:\\n\\n\\n\\'I bless the Lord I\\'ve got my seal-to-day and to-day-\\nTo slay Goliath in the field-to-day and to-day;\\nThe good old way is a righteous way,\\nI mean to take the kingdom in the good old way.\\'\\n\\n\\nWhile singing, she heard some enforcing obedience to their\\npromise, while a few seemed refusing to abide by it. But before\\nshe had quite concluded, she saw them turn from her, and in the\\ncourse of a few minutes, they were running as fast as they well\\ncould in a solid body; and she says she can compare them to\\nnothing but a swarm of bees, so dense was their phalanx, so\\nstraight their course, so hurried their march. As they passed with\\na rush very near the stand of the other preachers, the hearts of\\nthe people were smitten with fear, thinking that their entertainer\\nhad failed to enchain them longer with her spell, and that they\\nwere coming upon them with redoubled and remorseless fury.\\nBut they found they were mistaken, and that their fears were\\ngroundless; for, before they could well recover from their surprise,\\nevery rioter was gone, and not one was left on the\\ngrounds, or seen there again during the meeting. Sojourner was\\ninformed that as her audience reached the main road, some\\ndistance from the tents, a few of the rebellious spirits refused to\\ngo on, and proposed returning; but their leaders said, \\'No-we\\nhave promised to leave-all promised, and we must go, all go,\\nand you shall none of you return again.\\'\\n\\nShe did not fall in love at first sight with the Northampton\\nAssociation, for she arrived there at a time when appearances did\\nnot correspond with the ideas of associationists, as they had been\\nspread out in their writings; for their phalanx was a factory, and\\nthey were wanting in means to carry out their ideas of beauty\\nand elegance, as they would have done in different circumstances.\\nBut she thought she would make an effort to tarry with\\nthem one night, though that seemed to her no desirable affair.\\nBut as soon as she saw that accomplished, literary, and refined\\npersons were living in that plain and simple manner, and submitting\\nto the labors and privations incident to such an infant\\ninstitution, she said, \\'Well, if these can live here, I can.\\'\\nAfterwards, she gradually became pleased with, and attached to, the\\nplace and the people, as well she might; for it must have been no\\nsmall thing to have found a home in a \\'Community composed\\nof some of the choicest spirits of the age,\\' where all was\\ncharacterized\\nby an equality of feeling, a liberty of thought and speech,\\nand a largeness of soul, she could not have before met with, to\\nthe same extent, in any of her wanderings.\\n\\nOur first knowledge of her was derived from a friend who\\nhad resided for a time in the \\'Community,\\' and who, after\\ndescribing her, and singing one of her hymns, wished that we\\nmight see her. But we little thought, at that time, that we should\\never pen these \\'simple annals\\' of this child of nature.\\n\\nWhen we first saw her, she was working with a hearty good\\nwill; saying she would not be induced to take regular wages,\\nbelieving, as once before, that now Providence had provided her\\nwith a never-failing fount, from which her every want might be\\nperpetually supplied through her mortal life. In this, she had\\ncalculated too fast. For the Associationists found, that, taking\\nevery thing into consideration, they would find it most expedient\\nto act individually; and again, the subject of this sketch found\\nher dreams unreal, and herself flung back upon her own resources\\nfor the supply of her needs. This she might have found\\nmore inconvenient at her time of life-for labor, exposure, and\\nhardship had made sad inroads upon her iron constitution, by\\ninducing chronic disease and premature old age-had she not\\nremained under the shadow of one,* who never wearies in\\ndoing good, giving to the needy, and supplying the wants of the\\ndestitute. She has now set her heart upon having a little home\\nof her own, even at this late hour of life, where she may feel a\\ngreater freedom than she can in the house of another, and where\\nshe can repose a little, after her day of action has passed by. And\\nfor such a \\'home\\' she is now dependant on the charities of the\\nbenevolent, and to them we appeal with confidence.\\n\\nThrough all the scenes of her eventful life may be traced the\\nenergy of a naturally powerful mind-the fearlessness and child-like\\nsimplicity of one untrammelled by education or conventional\\ncustoms-purity of character-an unflinching adherence\\nto principle-and a native enthusiasm, which, under different\\ncircumstances, might easily have produced another Joan of Arc.\\n\\nWith all her fervor, and enthusiasm, and speculation, her\\nreligion is not tinctured in the least with gloom. No doubt, no\\nhesitation, no despondency, spreads a cloud over her soul; but\\nall is bright, clear, positive, and at times ecstatic. Her trust is in\\nGod, and from him she looks for good, and not evil. She feels\\nthat \\'perfect love casteth out fear.\\'\\n\\nHaving more than once found herself awaking from a mortifying\\ndelusion,-as in the case of the Sing-Sing kingdom,-and\\nresolving not to be thus deluded again, she has set suspicion to\\nguard the door of her heart, and allows it perhaps to be aroused\\nby too slight causes, on certain subjects-her vivid imagination\\nassisting to magnify the phantoms of her fears into gigantic\\nproportions, much beyond their real size; instead of resolutely\\nadhering to the rule we all like best, when it is to be applied to\\nourselves-that of placing every thing we see to the account of\\nthe best possible motive, until time and circumstance prove that\\nwe were wrong. Where no good motive can be assigned, it may\\nbecome our duty to suspend our judgment till evidence can be\\nhad.\\n\\nIn the application of this rule, it is an undoubted duty to\\nexercise a commendable prudence, by refusing to repose any\\nimportant trust to the keeping of persons who may be strangers\\nto us, and whose trustworthiness we have never seen tried. But\\nno possible good, but incalculable evil may and does arise from\\nthe too common practice of placing all conduct, the source of\\nwhich we do not fully understand, to the worst of intentions.\\nHow often is the gentle, timid soul discouraged, and driven\\nperhaps to despondency, by finding its \\'good evil spoken of;\\'\\nand a well-meant but mistaken action loaded with an evil design!\\n\\nIf the world would but sedulously set about reforming itself\\non this one point, who can calculate the change it would\\nproduce-the evil it would annihilate, and the happiness it would\\nconfer! None but an all-seeing eye could at once embrace so vast\\na result. A result, how desirable! and one that can be brought\\nabout only by the most simple process-that of every individual\\nseeing to it that he commit not this sin himself. For why should\\nwe allow in ourselves, the very fault we most dislike, when\\ncommitted against us? Shall we not at least aim at consistency?\\n\\nHad she possessed less generous self-sacrifice, more knowledge of\\nthe world and of business matters in general, and had she\\nfailed to take it for granted that others were like herself, and\\nwould, when her turn came to need, do as she had done, and\\nfind it \\'more blessed to give than to receive,\\' she might have\\nlaid by something for the future. For few, perhaps, have ever\\npossessed the power and inclination, in the same degree, at one\\nand the same time, to labor as she has done, both day and night,\\nfor so long a period of time. And had these energies been\\nwell-directed, and the proceeds well husbanded, since she has\\nbeen her own mistress, they would have given her an independence\\nduring her natural life. But her constitutional biases, and\\nher early training, or rather want of training, prevented this\\nresult; and it is too late now to remedy the great mistake. Shall\\nshe then be left to want? Who will not answer. \\'No!\\'\\n\\nNote:\\n* GEORGE W. BENSON.\\n\\n\\n\\nHER LAST INTERVIEW WITH HER MASTER.\\n\\n\\nIn the spring of 1849, Sojourner made a visit to her eldest\\ndaughter, Diana, who has ever suffered from ill health, and\\nremained with Mr. Dumont, Isabella\\'s humane master. She\\nfound him still living, though advanced in age, and reduced in\\nproperty, (as he had been for a number of years,) but greatly\\nenlightened on the subject of slavery. He said he could then see\\nthat \\'slavery was the wickedest thing in the world, the greatest\\ncurse the earth had ever felt-that it was then very clear to his\\nmind that it was so, though, while he was a slaveholder himself,\\nhe did not see it so, and thought it was as right as holding any\\nother property.\\' Sojourner remarked to him, that it might be\\nthe same with those who are now slaveholders. \\'O, no,\\'\\nreplied he, with warmth, \\'it cannot be. For, now, the sin of\\nslavery is so clearly written out, and so much talked against,-(why,\\nthe whole world cries out against it!)-that if any one says\\nhe don\\'t know, and has not heard, he must, I think, be a liar. In\\nmy slaveholding days, there were few that spoke against it, and\\nthese few made little impression on any one. Had it been as it\\nis now, think you I could have held slaves? No! I should not\\nhave dared to do it, but should have emancipated every one of\\nthem. Now, it is very different; all may hear if they will.\\'\\n\\nYes, reader, if any one feels that the tocsin of alarm, or the\\nanti-slavery trump, must sound a louder note before they can\\nhear it, one would think they must be very hard of hearing,-yea, that\\nthey belong to that class, of whom it may be truly said,\\n\\'they have stopped their ears that they may not hear.\\'\\n\\nShe received a letter from her daughter Diana, dated Hyde\\nPark, December 19, 1849, which informed her that Mr. Dumont had\\n\\'gone West\\' with some of his sons-that he had\\ntaken along with him, probably through mistake, the few articles\\nof furniture she had left with him. \\'Never mind,\\' says Sojourner,\\n\\'what we give to the poor, we lend to the Lord.\\' She\\nthanked the Lord with fervor, that she had lived to hear her\\nmaster say such blessed things! She recalled the lectures he used\\nto give his slaves, on speaking the truth and being honest, and\\nlaughing, she says he taught us not to lie and steal, when he was\\nstealing all the time himself, and did not know it! Oh! how sweet\\nto my mind was this confession! And what a confession for a\\nmaster to make to a slave! A slaveholding master turned to a\\nbrother! Poor old man, may the Lord bless him, and all slave-holders\\npartake of his spirit!\\n\\n\\n\\nCERTIFICATES OF CHARACTER.\\n\\n\\nHURLEY, ULSTER Co., Oct. 13th, 1834\\n\\nThis is to certify, that I am well acquainted with Isabella,\\nthis colored woman; I have been acquainted with her from\\nher infancy; she has been in my employ for one year, and\\nshe was a faithful servant, honest, and industrious; and have\\nalways known her to be in good report by all who employed her.\\n\\n\\nISAAC S. VAN WAGENEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEW PALTZ, ULSTER Co., Oct. 13th, 1834\\n\\nThis is to certify, that Isabella, this colored woman, lived\\nwith me since the year 1810, and that she has always been\\na good and faithful servant; and the eighteen years that she\\nwas with me, I always found her to be perfectly honest. I\\nhave always heard her well spoken of by every one that has\\nemployed her.\\n\\nJOHN J. DUMONT\\n\\n\\n\\nNORTHAMPTON, March 1850\\n\\nWe, the undersigned having known Isabella (or Sojourner\\nTruth) for several years, most cheerfully bear testimony to\\nher uniform good character, her untiring industry, kind\\ndeportment, unwearied benevolence, and the many social\\nand excellent traits which make her worthy to bear her\\nadopted name.\\n\\nGEO.

THAYER\\n\\n\\n\\nBOSTON, March, 1850\\n\\nMy acquaintance with the subject of the accompanying\\nNarrative, Sojourner Truth, for several years past, has led\\nme to form a very high appreciation of her understanding,\\nmoral integrity, disinterested kindness, and religious sincerity\\nand enlightenment.
